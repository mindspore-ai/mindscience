    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Aeroelastic problem of aircraft is a typical Fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problem, which studies the coupling relationship between aircraft structure and aerodynamic force. High accuracy Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology can accurately simulate the evolution process of the flow field around the structure to obtain the force situation of the structure, but the huge number of grids leads to high computing costs. Many researchers try to use the data-driven method to build the flow field evolution model to achieve rapid prediction of the flow field with high accuracy, so as to improve the simulation efficiency of the Fluid–structure interaction system. In recent years, the rapidly developing deep neural network technology relies on its powerful nonlinear learning ability and deep feature capture ability, and has achieved many successful applications in flow field modeling problems. Among them, flow field reconstruction achieves rapid prediction of different flow fields by constructing a mapping model between geometric shapes and flow conditions to flow field information at spatial points, which is highly concerned for its ability to quickly provide the current flow field state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to efficiently solve the flow field reconstruction of the Fluid–structure interaction problem, this paper coupled the neural network model with the computational structural dynamic equation, realized the modeling of the Fluid–structure interaction system, further improved the neural network structure, optimized the data structure, so as to obtain more accurate flow field prediction results and achieve more accurate Fluid–structure interaction response prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional Fluid–structure interaction numerical simulation framework consists of a Computational fluid dynamics solver and a computational Solid mechanics solver. The two solvers solve the state of the fluid and structure at the next moment in the fluid domain and the solid domain respectively, and transmit information at the interface as the input for the next calculation. The coupling process is shown in the following figure. The Fluid–structure interaction modeling framework based on the depth neural network proposed in this paper still uses the same strategy. The framework uses the depth neural network instead of the CFD solver to predict the flow field evolution. The structural response is still calculated by the CSD solver. The structural displacement and flow field surface pressure are transferred between the depth neural network and the computational Solid mechanics solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technology path\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific process of mindflow to solve this problem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Create data sets based on CFD numerical simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.The model is built using mindspire deep learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Define the optimizer and loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Use mindspire's instant compilation to accelerate model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Use the trained model for reasoning and visualization."

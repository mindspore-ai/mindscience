    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As an important tool to simulate and analyze fluid motion through numerical methods, CFD greatly facilitates the scientific research of fluid mechanics related issues, and plays an important role in providing accurate data and insights in the fields of design, optimization and research. One of the representative and research value problems in fluid mechanics is to simulate the unsteady flow field system with moving boundary to analyze the force of the moving structure in the flow field, which can optimize the design of the moving structure in engineering, and provide scheme strategies for the shape optimization of aerospace vehicles and navigation vehicles. High precision computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can accurately simulate the evolution of flow field and the stress of structure, but the high-precision dynamic boundary problem requires a large number of grids, which leads to huge hardware consumption and computational time cost. In addition, the construction of dynamic grids is also particularly time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "When CFD is applied to complex problems, the amount of calculation is huge and the calculation accuracy needs to be improved. An effective solution is given in the field of intelligent fluid mechanics. Deep learning can learn the evolution relationship between flow conditions and flow field through deep neural network, and quickly realize high-precision prediction and reconstruction of flow field. In order to efficiently solve the problem of reconstructing the flow field at the moving boundary, a hybrid depth neural network (hdnn) is proposed to reconstruct the unsteady flow field at the moving boundary, and fast predict the flow field based on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant dimensions of the flow field are shown in the figure, where $Y = Asin(2πft)$ represents the motion expression of the cylinder in a simple harmonic motion in the vertical direction, a is the amplitude, f is the frequency; D stands for cylinder diameter; The rectangular boundary represents the computational domain. When the uniform incoming flow flows through a moving cylinder, under the influence of the interaction between the fluid and the solid, a series of complex flow phenomena will be formed behind the cylinder, such as boundary layer separation, alternating Karman vortex street and so on, and evolve into a non-uniform flow field whose physical quantities change periodically with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technology path\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific process of mindflow to solve this problem is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Create data sets based on CFD numerical simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.The model is built using mindspire deep learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Define the optimizer and loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Use mindspire's instant compilation to accelerate model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Use the trained model for reasoning and visualization."

    "+ The moving boundary flow field prediction is started by executing eval.py, which can be divided into two prediction methods: single step flow field prediction (infer_mode is \"one\") and continuous flow field prediction within a vibration period (infer_mode is \"cycle\"); Single step flow field prediction only predicts the flow field of one time step at the next moment, while continuous flow field prediction continuously predicts the flow field of a complete cycle\n",
    "+ The following figure shows the results of a fully trained HDNN model for one-step prediction and one complete cycle prediction of unsteady moving boundaries with a vibration frequency of 1.43Hz and an amplitude of 0.8 (amplitude ratio generalization state) (displaying pressure field, horizontal velocity field, and vertical velocity field)"

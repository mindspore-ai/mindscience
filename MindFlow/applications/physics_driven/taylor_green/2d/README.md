# 2D Taylor Green Vortex

## Overview

In fluid dynamics, the Taylor–Green vortex is an unsteady flow of a decaying vortex, which has an exact closed form solution of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in Cartesian coordinates. In this case, the data-driven characteristic of neural network is used along with `PINNs` to solve the 2D taylor green vortex problem.

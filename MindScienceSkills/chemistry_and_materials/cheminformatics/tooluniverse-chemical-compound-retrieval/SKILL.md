# Chemical Compound Information Retrieval

Retrieve comprehensive chemical compound data with proper disambiguation and cross-database validation.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English compound names and search terms in tool calls, even if the user writes in another language (e.g., translate "阿司匹林" to "aspirin"). Only try original-language terms as a fallback if English returns no results. Respond in the user's language.

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 0: Clarify (if needed)
    ↓
Phase 1: Disambiguate Compound Identity
    ↓
Phase 2: Retrieve Data (Internal)
    ↓
Phase 3: Report Compound Profile
```

---

## Phase 0: Clarification (When Needed)

Ask the user ONLY if:
- Compound name is highly ambiguous (e.g., "vitamin E" → α, β, γ, δ-tocopherol?)
- Multiple distinct compounds share the name (e.g., "aspirin" is clear; "sterol" is not)

Skip clarification for:
- Unambiguous drug names (aspirin, ibuprofen, metformin)
- Specific identifiers provided (CID, ChEMBL ID, SMILES)
- Clear structural queries (SMILES, InChI)

---

## Phase 1: Compound Disambiguation

### 1.1 Resolve Primary Identifier

```python
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse
tu = ToolUniverse()
tu.load_tools()

# Strategy depends on input type
if user_provided_cid:
    cid = user_provided_cid
elif user_provided_smiles:
    result = tu.tools.PubChem_get_CID_by_SMILES(smiles=smiles)
    cid = result["data"]["cid"]
elif user_provided_name:
    result = tu.tools.PubChem_get_CID_by_compound_name(compound_name=name)
    cid = result["data"]["cid"]
```

### 1.2 Cross-Reference Identifiers

Always establish compound identity across both databases:

```python
# PubChem → ChEMBL cross-reference
chembl_result = tu.tools.ChEMBL_search_compounds(query=compound_name, limit=5)
if chembl_result["data"]:
    chembl_id = chembl_result["data"][0]["molecule_chembl_id"]
```

### 1.3 Handle Naming Collisions

For generic names (e.g., "vitamin", "steroid", "acid"):
- Search returns multiple CIDs → present top matches with structures
- Verify SMILES/InChI matches user intent
- Note stereoisomers or salt forms if relevant

**Identity Resolution Checklist:**
- [ ] PubChem CID established
- [ ] ChEMBL ID cross-referenced (if exists)
- [ ] Canonical SMILES captured
- [ ] Stereochemistry noted (if relevant)
- [ ] Salt forms identified (if applicable)

---

## Phase 2: Data Retrieval (Internal)

Retrieve all data silently. Do NOT narrate the search process.

### 2.1 Core Properties (PubChem)

```python
# Basic properties
props = tu.tools.PubChem_get_compound_properties_by_CID(cid=cid)

# Bioactivity summary
bio = tu.tools.PubChemBioAssay_get_assay_summary(cid=cid)

# Drug label (if approved drug)
drug = tu.tools.PubChemTox_get_acute_effects(cid=cid)

# Structure image
image = tu.tools.PubChem_get_compound_2D_image_by_CID(cid=cid)
```

### 2.2 Bioactivity Data (ChEMBL)

```python
if chembl_id:
    # Detailed bioactivity
    activity = tu.tools.ChEMBL_get_bioactivity_by_chemblid(chembl_id=chembl_id)
    
    # Protein targets
    targets = tu.tools.ChEMBL_get_target_by_chemblid(chembl_id=chembl_id)
    
    # Assay data
    assays = tu.tools.ChEMBL_get_assays_by_chemblid(chembl_id=chembl_id)
```

### 2.3 Optional Extended Data

```python
# Patents (for drugs)
patents = tu.tools.PubChem_get_associated_patents_by_CID(cid=cid)

# Similar compounds (for SAR)
similar = tu.tools.PubChem_search_compounds_by_similarity(cid=cid, threshold=85)
```

### Fallback Chains

|---------|----------|-------|
| PubChem_get_CID_by_compound_name | ChEMBL_search_compounds → get SMILES → PubChem_get_CID_by_SMILES | Name lookup failed |

## Reasoning Framework for Result Interpretation

### Evidence Grading

| Grade | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Confirmed identity** | PubChem CID + ChEMBL ID cross-match, InChI/SMILES agree, reviewed in DrugBank or ChEMBL | Aspirin: CID 2244, CHEMBL25, consistent SMILES across databases |
| **Probable identity** | PubChem CID found, ChEMBL partial match, minor stereochemistry ambiguity | Natural product with CID but ChEMBL entry lacking full stereochem |
| **Uncertain identity** | Only one database has entry, or name resolves to multiple CIDs | "Vitamin E" returning alpha- and gamma-tocopherol CIDs |
| **Unverified** | No cross-reference, single-source data only | Novel compound with PubChem SID only, no CID assigned |

### Interpretation Guidance

- **Compound identity confidence**: Always cross-reference PubChem CID with ChEMBL ID. If InChI strings match across databases, identity is confirmed. Discrepancies in SMILES may reflect salt forms, stereoisomers, or tautomers -- flag these for the user.
- **Data source priority for bioactivity**: ChEMBL > PubChem BioAssay for curated bioactivity data. ChEMBL entries are manually curated from medicinal chemistry literature with standardized activity units. PubChem BioAssay aggregates HTS results with variable quality. For drug-target interactions, ChEMBL IC50/Ki values are more reliable than PubChem confirmatory assay flags.
- **Cross-reference validation**: A compound profile is most reliable when 3+ databases agree on structure and activity (PubChem + ChEMBL + DrugBank for approved drugs). Single-source bioactivity claims, especially from a single assay, should be flagged as preliminary.
- **Lipinski assessment**: Ro5 violations do not disqualify a compound but reduce oral bioavailability likelihood. Many approved drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) violate Ro5. Report violations as context, not as pass/fail.
- **Bioactivity values**: IC50/Ki < 100 nM = potent; 100 nM - 1 uM = moderate; > 10 uM = weak. Activity type matters: IC50 is assay-dependent; Ki is more comparable across assays.

### Synthesis Questions

1. Does the compound identity resolve unambiguously across PubChem and ChEMBL, or are there stereochemical or salt-form variants that could affect interpretation?
2. Is the bioactivity data from ChEMBL based on multiple independent publications, or does it rely on a single study?
3. For drug candidates, do the molecular properties (MW, LogP, PSA) fall within drug-like space, and are there structural alerts (PAINS, reactive groups) that warrant caution?

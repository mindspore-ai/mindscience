# Gene Expression & Omics Data Retrieval

Retrieve gene expression experiments and multi-omics datasets with proper disambiguation and quality assessment.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English terms in tool calls (gene names, tissue names, condition descriptions), even if the user writes in another language. Only try original-language terms as a fallback if English returns no results. Respond in the user's language.

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 0: Clarify Query (if ambiguous)
    ↓
Phase 1: Disambiguate Gene/Condition
    ↓
Phase 2: Search & Retrieve (Internal)
    ↓
Phase 3: Report Dataset Profile
```

---

## Phase 0: Clarification (When Needed)

Ask the user ONLY if:
- Gene name is ambiguous (e.g., "p53" → TP53 or MDM2 studies?)
- Tissue/condition unclear for comparative studies
- Organism not specified for non-human research

Skip clarification for:
- Specific accession numbers (E-MTAB-*, E-GEOD-*, S-BSST*)
- Clear disease/tissue + organism combinations
- Explicit platform requests (RNA-seq, microarray)

---

## Phase 1: Query Disambiguation

### 1.1 Gene Name Resolution

If searching by gene, first resolve official identifiers:

```python
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse
tu = ToolUniverse()
tu.load_tools()

# For gene-focused searches, resolve official symbol first
# This helps construct better search queries
# Example: "p53" → "TP53" (official HGNC symbol)
```

**Gene Disambiguation Checklist:**
- [ ] Official gene symbol identified (HGNC for human, MGI for mouse)
- [ ] Common aliases noted for search expansion
- [ ] Species confirmed

### 1.2 Construct Search Strategy

| User Query Type | Search Strategy |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Specific accession | Direct retrieval |
| Gene + condition | "[gene] [condition]" + species filter |
| Disease only | "[disease]" + species filter |
| Technology-specific | Add platform keywords (RNA-seq, microarray) |

---

## Phase 2: Data Retrieval (Internal)

Search silently. Do NOT narrate the process.

### 2.1 Search Experiments

```python
# ArrayExpress search
result = tu.tools.arrayexpress_search_experiments(
    keywords="[gene/disease] [condition]",
    species="[species]",
    limit=20
)

# BioStudies for multi-omics
biostudies_result = tu.tools.biostudies_search(
    query="[keywords]",
    limit=10
)
```

### 2.2 Get Experiment Details

For top results, retrieve full metadata:

```python
# Get details for each relevant experiment
details = tu.tools.arrayexpress_get_experiment(
    accession=accession
)

# Get sample information
samples = tu.tools.arrayexpress_get_experiment_samples(
    accession=accession
)

# Get available files
files = tu.tools.arrayexpress_get_experiment_files(
    accession=accession
)
```

### 2.3 BioStudies Retrieval

```python
# Multi-omics study details
study_details = tu.tools.biostudies_get_study(
    accession=study_accession
)

# Study structure
sections = tu.tools.biostudies_get_study_sections(
    accession=study_accession
)

# Available files
files = tu.tools.biostudies_get_study_files(
    accession=study_accession
)
```

### Fallback Chains

| Primary | Fallback | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| ArrayExpress search | BioStudies search | ArrayExpress empty |
| arrayexpress_get_experiment | biostudies_get_study | E-GEOD may have BioStudies mirror |
| arrayexpress_get_experiment_files | Note "Files unavailable" | Some studies restrict downloads |

## Data Quality Tiers

Assessment criteria for expression experiments:

| Tier | Symbol | Criteria |
|------|--------|----------|
| High Quality | ●●● | ≥3 bio replicates, complete metadata, processed data available |
| Medium Quality | ●●○ | 2-3 replicates OR some metadata gaps, data accessible |
| Low Quality | ●○○ | No replicates, sparse metadata, or data access issues |
| Use with Caution | ○○○ | Single sample, no replication, outdated platform |

Include assessment rationale:
```markdown
**Quality**: ●●● High
- ✓ 4 biological replicates per condition
- ✓ Complete sample annotations
- ✓ Processed and raw data available
- ✓ Recent RNA-seq platform
```

---

## Reasoning Framework for Result Interpretation

### Evidence Grading

| Grade | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **High confidence** | >= 3 bio replicates, complete metadata, processed + raw data, recent platform | E-MTAB RNA-seq with 4 replicates, full annotations, FASTQ + counts |
| **Moderate confidence** | 2-3 replicates, partial metadata, data accessible | E-GEOD microarray with 2 replicates, some missing annotations |
| **Low confidence** | No replicates, sparse metadata, or outdated platform | Single-sample microarray from 2005 with no condition labels |
| **Use with caution** | Pre-print only, missing raw data, or conflicting metadata | Study with sample swap indicators or retracted publication |

### Interpretation Guidance

- **Dataset quality assessment**: Prioritize experiments with >= 3 biological replicates per condition, complete sample annotations (condition, tissue, sex, age), and both raw and processed data available. Single-replicate experiments can inform but should not be sole evidence.
- **Platform comparison**: RNA-seq provides wider dynamic range and detects novel transcripts; microarray is limited to probe-designed genes but has extensive legacy data. When combining datasets across platforms, batch correction is essential. Prefer RNA-seq for low-abundance transcripts and splice variant analysis.
- **Metadata completeness scoring**: Rate each dataset on 5 axes -- (1) sample annotations present, (2) experimental design documented, (3) processing pipeline described, (4) raw data deposited, (5) associated publication. Score 0-5; datasets scoring <= 2 warrant caution in downstream analysis.
- **Cross-platform validation**: When the same gene/condition appears in both RNA-seq and microarray datasets, concordant results increase confidence. Discordant results may reflect platform bias, batch effects, or biological variability.
- **GEO vs ArrayExpress**: GEO has broader coverage (especially older studies); ArrayExpress enforces stricter metadata standards. BioStudies captures multi-omics designs. Search both for comprehensive retrieval.

### Synthesis Questions

1. Does the dataset have sufficient biological replication and metadata to support the intended downstream analysis (e.g., differential expression, co-expression networks)?
2. Are there batch effects or confounding variables (e.g., all treatment samples processed on one date) that could compromise the results?
3. If multiple datasets cover the same condition, do they show concordant expression patterns, and can they be meaningfully integrated despite platform or cohort differences?

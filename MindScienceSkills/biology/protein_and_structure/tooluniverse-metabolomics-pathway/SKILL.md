# Metabolomics Pathway Analysis Skill

Systematic metabolomics workflow: identify metabolites, map to metabolic pathways, find disease associations, and connect to enzymes/genes for multi-omics integration.

## When to Use

- "What pathways involve glucose and pyruvate?"
- "Which diseases are associated with elevated homocysteine?"
- "Identify this metabolite from m/z 180.063 and map its pathways"
- "Find metabolic pathways disrupted in phenylketonuria"
- "Get disease associations for a list of metabolites from an MS experiment"
- "What enzymes catalyze the conversion of phenylalanine?"
- "Cross-reference HMDB metabolites with KEGG pathways"

**NOT for** (use other skills instead):
- Drug safety/ADMET profiling -> Use `tooluniverse-chemical-safety`
- Gene enrichment/pathway analysis from gene lists -> Use `tooluniverse-gene-enrichment`
- Drug-target validation -> Use `tooluniverse-drug-target-validation`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Correction |
|---------|-----------|
| Passing array to ReactomeAnalysis_pathway_enrichment | `identifiers` must be space-separated string |
| Using HMDB IDs in CTD_get_chemical_diseases | CTD uses common chemical names or MeSH IDs, not HMDB IDs |
| Not resolving metabolite names first | Always start with Metabolite_search to get canonical name and CID |
| Using gene_id without organism prefix for KEGG | KEGG gene IDs need organism prefix: "hsa:5230" not "5230" |
| Expecting HMDB API to work directly | HMDB has no open API; use Metabolite_get_info (PubChem-backed) instead |
| Passing PubChem title to CTD when names differ | CTD may use different names; try both PubChem name and common synonyms |
| MetabolomicsWorkbench exactmass endpoint | Use moverz/REFMET/{mass}/M/{tolerance} format (exactmass endpoint broken) |

---

## Fallback Strategies

- **Metabolite_search returns no results** -> Try MetabolomicsWorkbench_search_compound_by_name or KEGG_get_compound with KEGG ID
- **MetaCyc pathway not found** -> Search KEGG pathways or Reactome pathways instead
- **CTD returns empty for disease** -> Try Metabolite_get_diseases with HMDB ID or PubChem CID
- **No KEGG compound ID** -> Use BridgeDb_xrefs to cross-reference from HMDB or ChEBI
- **MetabolomicsWorkbench exactmass fails** -> Use search_by_mz with M+H adduct and appropriate tolerance
- **Need enzyme genes** -> CTD_get_chemical_gene_interactions returns gene symbols for any chemical

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Single Metabolite Deep Analysis (Homocysteine)

```
Step 1: Metabolite_search(query="homocysteine")
  -> Get PubChem CID, molecular formula, SMILES

Step 2: Metabolite_get_info(compound_name="homocysteine")
  -> Get HMDB ID, classification, biological roles

Step 3: MetaCyc_search_pathways(query="homocysteine")
  -> Find pathways: methionine cycle, transsulfuration

Step 4: CTD_get_chemical_gene_interactions(input_terms="homocysteine")
  -> Get enzymes: CBS, MTR, MTHFR, BHMT

Step 5: Metabolite_get_diseases(compound_name="homocysteine")
  -> Get disease associations: hyperhomocysteinemia, cardiovascular disease, neural tube defects

Step 6: KEGG_get_compound(compound_id="C00155")
  -> Get KEGG pathways, linked reactions

Step 7: Report with pathway map, enzyme list, disease associations
```

### Workflow 2: m/z-Based Metabolite Identification

```
Step 1: MetabolomicsWorkbench_search_by_mz(mz=180.063, adduct="M+H", tolerance=0.01)
  -> Candidate metabolites from RefMet

Step 2: For each candidate:
  Metabolite_get_info(compound_name=candidate_name)
  -> Confirm identity, get cross-database IDs

Step 3: MetaCyc_search_pathways(query=confirmed_metabolite)
  -> Map to metabolic pathways

Step 4: CTD_get_chemical_diseases(input_terms=confirmed_metabolite)
  -> Disease relevance
```

### Workflow 3: Metabolite List Pathway Enrichment

```
Step 1: For each metabolite in list:
  Metabolite_search(query=name) -> get canonical name
  CTD_get_chemical_gene_interactions(input_terms=name) -> get enzyme genes

Step 2: Collect unique gene list from all metabolites

Step 3: ReactomeAnalysis_pathway_enrichment(identifiers="GENE1 GENE2 GENE3")
  -> Enriched metabolic pathways

Step 4: For top enriched pathways:
  Reactome_get_pathway(id=pathway_id) -> pathway details

Step 5: Report: enriched pathways, participating metabolites, disease links
```

### Workflow 4: Disease-Focused Metabolite Discovery

```
Step 1: CTD_get_chemical_diseases(input_terms="phenylketonuria")
  -> ERROR: CTD expects chemical input. Instead:

Step 1 (corrected): PubMed_search_articles(query="phenylketonuria metabolomics biomarkers")
  -> Find key metabolites from literature

Step 2: For identified metabolites (phenylalanine, tyrosine):
  Metabolite_get_diseases(compound_name="phenylalanine")
  -> Confirm disease association

Step 3: MetaCyc_search_pathways(query="phenylalanine")
  -> Map disrupted pathways

Step 4: CTD_get_chemical_gene_interactions(input_terms="phenylalanine")
  -> Identify PAH (phenylalanine hydroxylase) and related enzymes

Step 5: CTD_get_gene_diseases(input_terms="PAH")
  -> Confirm gene-disease link
```

## Evidence Grading

| Tier | Criteria | Sources |
|------|----------|---------|
| **T1** | Curated disease association with direct evidence | CTD curated, OMIM |
| **T2** | Multiple database pathway concordance | MetaCyc + KEGG + Reactome agreement |
| **T3** | Inferred associations or single-database | CTD inferred, single pathway DB |
| **T4** | Computational prediction or text-mining only | Literature search, RefMet classification |

---

## Limitations

- HMDB has no open API; metabolite info comes from PubChem via Metabolite_get_info.
- MetaCyc pathways are reference pathways (not organism-specific like KEGG).
- CTD chemical-disease associations can be very large for common metabolites (22K+ for acetaminophen).
- MetabolomicsWorkbench exactmass endpoint is broken; use moverz/REFMET instead.
- ReactomeAnalysis_pathway_enrichment expects gene/protein IDs, not metabolite IDs directly.
- Metabolite name discrepancies between PubChem and CTD may require trying synonyms.
- BridgeDb metabolite coverage depends on the metabolite being in the mapping databases.

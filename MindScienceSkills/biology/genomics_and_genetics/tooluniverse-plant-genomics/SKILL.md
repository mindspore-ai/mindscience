# Plant Genomics & Biology

Pipeline for investigating plant genes, metabolic pathways, species taxonomy, and comparative plant biology using ToolUniverse tools.

**Key principles**:
1. **Plant-specific pathways** — photosynthesis, secondary metabolism, hormone signaling are unique to plants
2. **PlantReactome as foundation** — curated plant pathway database with cross-species coverage (Oryza, Arabidopsis, Zea mays, etc.)
3. **Ensembl Plants for genomics** — use Ensembl with plant species names for gene lookup and annotation
4. **KEGG for metabolism** — KEGG has plant-specific organism codes (ath=Arabidopsis, osa=rice, zma=maize)
5. **Evidence grading** — T1: functional validation (mutant phenotype), T2: expression/localization data, T3: ortholog-based prediction, T4: computational annotation only

## When to Use

- "What pathway is [plant gene] involved in?"
- "Find genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway"
- "Compare [gene] across Arabidopsis and rice"
- "What species is [plant name]?"
- "Plant hormone signaling pathways"
- "Photosynthesis gene annotation"

**Not this skill**: For general pathway analysis (human/mouse), use `tooluniverse-systems-biology`. For phylogenetics, use `tooluniverse-phylogenetics`.

## Core Tools

| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `PlantReactome_search_pathways` | Search plant-specific pathways by keyword |
| `PlantReactome_get_pathway` | Get pathway details (genes, reactions, species) |
| `PlantReactome_list_species` | List all species covered by PlantReactome |
| `POWO_search_plants` | Search Plants of the World Online (taxonomy, distribution) |
| `ensembl_lookup_gene` | Gene lookup — use with plant species (e.g., `species="arabidopsis_thaliana"`) |
| `kegg_search_pathway` | Search KEGG pathways (use plant organism codes: ath, osa, zma) |
| `KEGG_get_pathway_genes` | Get genes in a plant pathway (e.g., `pathway_id="ath00941"` for flavonoid in Arabidopsis) |
| `UniProt_search` | Search plant protein sequences (add `taxonomy_id:3702` for Arabidopsis) |
| `UniProt_get_function_by_accession` | Get protein function annotation |
| `PubMed_search_articles` | Plant biology literature |
| `EnsemblCompara_get_orthologues` | Cross-species plant gene comparison |

## Workflow

```
Phase 0: Species & Gene Identification
  Species name → POWO taxonomy; Gene symbol → Ensembl/UniProt IDs
    |
Phase 1: Gene Function & Annotation
  UniProt function, Ensembl annotation, InterPro domains
    |
Phase 2: Pathway Analysis
  PlantReactome → plant-specific pathways; KEGG → metabolism
    |
Phase 3: Cross-Species Comparison
  Ensembl Compara → orthologs in other plant species
    |
Phase 4: Literature & Report
  PubMed → published studies; synthesis
```

### Phase 1: Gene Function

```python
# Look up an Arabidopsis gene
ensembl_lookup_gene(gene_symbol="CHS", species="arabidopsis_thaliana")
# Get protein function
UniProt_search(query="CHS AND taxonomy_id:3702 AND reviewed:true")
```

### Phase 2: Plant Pathway Analysis

**Key plant-specific KEGG pathways**:

| Pathway | KEGG ID (Arabidopsis) | Biological Significance |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Photosynthesis | ath00195 | Light reactions, electron transport |
| Carbon fixation (Calvin cycle) | ath00710 | CO2 → sugar |
| Flavonoid biosynthesis | ath00941 | UV protection, pigmentation, defense |
| Carotenoid biosynthesis | ath00906 | Photoprotection, vitamin A precursors |
| Auxin signaling | ath04075 | Growth, tropisms |
| Brassinosteroid signaling | ath04712 | Cell elongation, stress response |
| Circadian rhythm (plant) | ath04712 | Photoperiod, flowering time |
| Terpenoid backbone | ath00900 | Secondary metabolite precursors |
| Starch/sucrose metabolism | ath00500 | Carbon partitioning |
| Nitrogen metabolism | ath00910 | Nitrogen assimilation |

```python
# Search PlantReactome for flavonoid pathway
PlantReactome_search_pathways(query="flavonoid")
# Get genes in Arabidopsis flavonoid biosynthesis
KEGG_get_pathway_genes(pathway_id="ath00941")
```

### Phase 3: Species Comparison

**KEGG organism codes for major crops**:

| Species | Code | Common Name |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Arabidopsis thaliana | ath | Thale cress (model plant) |
| Oryza sativa | osa | Rice |
| Zea mays | zma | Maize/corn |
| Triticum aestivum | tae | Wheat |
| Glycine max | gmx | Soybean |
| Solanum lycopersicum | sly | Tomato |
| Nicotiana tabacum | nta | Tobacco |
| Medicago truncatula | mtr | Barrel medic (legume model) |

### Phase 4: Interpretation Framework

### Evidence Grading

| Grade | Criteria | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **T1** | Mutant phenotype confirms function | Arabidopsis chs mutant lacks flavonoids |
| **T2** | Expression/localization data supports role | Gene expressed in guard cells → stomatal function |
| **T3** | Ortholog has validated function in model species | Rice ortholog of Arabidopsis FLC controls flowering |
| **T4** | Computational annotation only (InterPro domain, GO term) | Predicted kinase by domain |

### Synthesis Questions

1. **Is the gene plant-specific or conserved?** (Plant-specific genes often in secondary metabolism; conserved genes in primary metabolism)
2. **Which tissues/developmental stages express it?** (Root vs shoot vs flower vs seed)
3. **Is there a crop improvement application?** (Yield, stress tolerance, nutritional quality)
4. **What regulatory mechanisms control it?** (Hormone-responsive, light-regulated, circadian)
5. **Are there natural variants with known phenotypes?** (Accession diversity in Arabidopsis 1001 Genomes)

## Limitations

- **No TAIR tool** — The Arabidopsis Information Resource has no public REST API. Use Ensembl Plants and UniProt as alternatives for Arabidopsis gene data.
- **PlantReactome coverage** — Focused on Oryza sativa (rice) with cross-references to Arabidopsis. Not all plant species equally covered.
- **No crop breeding tools** — This skill covers gene/pathway analysis, not marker-assisted selection or breeding simulation.
- **POWO is taxonomy-focused** — Plants of the World Online provides species identification and distribution, not genomics data.

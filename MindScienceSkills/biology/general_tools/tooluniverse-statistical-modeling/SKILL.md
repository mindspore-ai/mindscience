## When to Use

Apply this skill when user asks:
- "What is the odds ratio of X associated with Y?"
- "What is the hazard ratio for treatment?"
- "Fit a linear regression of Y on X1, X2, X3"
- "Perform ordinal logistic regression for severity outcome"

- "What is the F-statistic from ANOVA comparing groups?"
- "Test if gene/miRNA expression differs across cell types"

## Model Selection Decision Tree

```
START: What type of outcome variable?
|
+-- CONTINUOUS (height, blood pressure, score)
|   +-- Independent observations -> Linear Regression (OLS)
|   +-- Repeated measures -> Mixed-Effects Model (LMM)
|   +-- Count data -> Poisson/Negative Binomial
|
+-- BINARY (yes/no, disease/healthy)
|   +-- Independent observations -> Logistic Regression
|   +-- Repeated measures -> Logistic Mixed-Effects (GLMM/GEE)
|   +-- Rare events -> Firth logistic regression
|
+-- ORDINAL (mild/moderate/severe, stages I/II/III/IV)
|   +-- Ordinal Logistic Regression (Proportional Odds)
|
+-- MULTINOMIAL (>2 unordered categories)
|   +-- Multinomial Logistic Regression
|
+-- TIME-TO-EVENT (survival time + censoring)
    +-- Regression -> Cox Proportional Hazards
    +-- Survival curves -> Kaplan-Meier
```

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Data Validation

**Goal**: Load data, identify variable types, check for missing values.

**CRITICAL: Identify the Outcome Variable First**

Before any analysis, verify what you're actually predicting:

1. **Read the full question** - Look for "predict [outcome]", "model [outcome]", or "dependent variable"
2. **Examine available columns** - List all columns in the dataset
3. **Match question to data** - Find the column that matches the described outcome
4. **Verify outcome exists** - Don't create outcome variables from predictors

**Common mistake**: Question mentions "obesity" -> Assumed outcome = BMI >= 30 (circular logic with BMI predictor). Always check data columns first: `print(df.columns.tolist())`

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
print(f"Observations: {len(df)}, Variables: {len(df.columns)}, Missing: {df.isnull().sum().sum()}")

for col in df.columns:
    n_unique = df[col].nunique()
    if n_unique == 2:
        print(f"{col}: binary")
    elif n_unique <= 10 and df[col].dtype == 'object':
        print(f"{col}: categorical ({n_unique} levels)")
    elif df[col].dtype in ['float64', 'int64']:
        print(f"{col}: continuous (mean={df[col].mean():.2f})")
```

### Phase 1: Model Fitting

**Goal**: Fit appropriate model based on outcome type.

Use the decision tree above to select model type, then refer to the appropriate reference file for detailed code:

- **Linear Regression**: `references/linear_models.md`
- **Logistic Regression** (binary): `references/logistic_regression.md`
- **Ordinal Logistic**: `references/ordinal_logistic.md`
- **Cox Proportional Hazards**: `references/cox_regression.md`
- **ANOVA / Statistical Tests**: `anova_and_tests.md`

**Quick reference for key models**:

```python
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import numpy as np

# Linear regression
model = smf.ols('outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2', data=df).fit()

# Logistic regression (odds ratios)
model = smf.logit('disease ~ exposure + age + sex', data=df).fit(disp=0)
ors = np.exp(model.params)
ci = np.exp(model.conf_int())

# Cox proportional hazards
from lifelines import CoxPHFitter
cph = CoxPHFitter()
cph.fit(df[['time', 'event', 'treatment', 'age']], duration_col='time', event_col='event')
hr = cph.hazard_ratios_['treatment']
```

### Phase 1b: ANOVA for Multi-Feature Data

When data has multiple features (genes, miRNAs, metabolites), use **per-feature ANOVA** (not aggregate). This is the most common pattern in genomics.

See `anova_and_tests.md` for the full decision tree, both methods, and worked examples.

**Default for gene expression data**: Per-feature ANOVA (Method B).

### Phase 2: Model Diagnostics

**Goal**: Check model assumptions and fit quality.

Key diagnostics by model type:
- **OLS**: Shapiro-Wilk (normality), Breusch-Pagan (heteroscedasticity), VIF (multicollinearity)
- **Cox**: Proportional hazards test via `cph.check_assumptions()`
- **Logistic**: Hosmer-Lemeshow, ROC/AUC

See `references/troubleshooting.md` for diagnostic code and common issues.

### Phase 3: Interpretation

**Goal**: Generate publication-quality summary.

For every result, report: effect size (OR/HR/coefficient), 95% CI, p-value, and model fit statistic. See `bixbench_patterns_summary.md` for common question-answer patterns.

## Common BixBench Patterns

| Pattern | Question Type | Key Steps |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Odds ratio from ordinal regression | Fit OrderedModel, exp(coef) |
| 2 | Percentage reduction in OR | Compare crude vs adjusted model |
| 3 | Interaction effects | Fit `A * B`, extract `A:B` coef |
| 4 | Hazard ratio | Cox PH model, exp(coef) |
| 5 | Multi-feature ANOVA | Per-feature F-stats (not aggregate) |

See `bixbench_patterns_summary.md` for solution code for each pattern.
See `references/bixbench_patterns.md` for 15+ detailed question patterns.

## Statsmodels vs Scikit-learn

| Use Case | Library | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Inference** (p-values, CIs, ORs) | **statsmodels** | Full statistical output |
| **Prediction** (accuracy, AUC) | **scikit-learn** | Better prediction tools |
| **Mixed-effects models** | **statsmodels** | Only option |
| **Regularization** (LASSO, Ridge) | **scikit-learn** | Better optimization |
| **Survival analysis** | **lifelines** | Specialized library |

**General rule**: Use statsmodels for BixBench questions (they ask for p-values, ORs, HRs).

## Python Package Requirements

```
statsmodels>=0.14.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
lifelines>=0.27.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scipy>=1.10.0
```

## Key Principles

1. **Data-first approach** - Always inspect and validate data before modeling
2. **Model selection by outcome type** - Use decision tree above
3. **Assumption checking** - Verify model assumptions (linearity, proportional hazards, etc.)
4. **Complete reporting** - Always report effect sizes, CIs, p-values, and model fit statistics
5. **Confounder awareness** - Adjust for confounders when specified or clinically relevant
6. **Reproducible analysis** - All code must be deterministic and reproducible
7. **Robust error handling** - Graceful handling of convergence failures, separation, collinearity
8. **Round correctly** - Match the precision requested (typically 2-4 decimal places)

## Reasoning Framework for Result Interpretation

### Evidence Grading

| Grade | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Strong** | p < 0.001, effect size clinically meaningful, model assumptions met | OR = 3.5 (95% CI: 2.1-5.8), p < 0.001, Hosmer-Lemeshow p > 0.05 |
| **Moderate** | p < 0.05, reasonable effect size, minor assumption concerns | HR = 1.8 (95% CI: 1.1-2.9), p = 0.02, borderline PH test |
| **Weak** | p < 0.05 but wide CI, small effect, or assumption violations | OR = 1.2 (95% CI: 1.01-1.43), p = 0.04, VIF > 5 for a covariate |
| **Insufficient** | p >= 0.05, or model fails convergence/diagnostics | Non-significant coefficient with model separation warning |

### Interpretation Guidance

- **Model diagnostics (R-squared)**: For OLS, R-squared > 0.7 indicates good fit in biomedical data; 0.3-0.7 is moderate. Adjusted R-squared penalizes added predictors. For logistic models, use pseudo-R-squared (McFadden > 0.2 is acceptable) and AUC (> 0.7 = acceptable, > 0.8 = good discrimination).
- **AIC/BIC for model comparison**: Lower is better. AIC difference > 10 between models is strong evidence for the lower-AIC model. BIC penalizes complexity more heavily than AIC, preferring simpler models. Use AIC for prediction-focused selection, BIC for inference.
- **Coefficient significance thresholds**: Report exact p-values rather than just significance stars. For multiple predictors, apply Bonferroni or FDR correction. A coefficient with p = 0.049 in a model with 20 predictors is likely a false positive without correction.
- **Survival analysis HR interpretation**: HR > 1 means increased hazard (worse outcome) for the exposed group. HR = 2.0 means twice the instantaneous risk of the event. Always verify the proportional hazards assumption -- if violated, the HR is an average over time and may be misleading. Report median survival times alongside HRs for clinical interpretability.
- **Odds ratio interpretation**: OR = 1.0 means no association. OR > 1 indicates increased odds. The 95% CI excluding 1.0 confirms significance. For rare outcomes, OR approximates relative risk; for common outcomes (> 10% prevalence), OR overstates the relative risk.
- **Confounding assessment**: Compare crude vs adjusted ORs/HRs. A change > 10% in the effect estimate after adjusting for a covariate suggests confounding by that variable.

### Synthesis Questions

1. Do the model diagnostics (residual plots, Hosmer-Lemeshow, PH test) support the validity of the chosen model, or do assumption violations require alternative approaches (e.g., robust standard errors, stratified models)?
2. For adjusted models, does the inclusion of confounders change the primary effect estimate by more than 10%, indicating meaningful confounding?
3. Are the reported effect sizes (OR, HR, coefficients) clinically meaningful in addition to being statistically significant, considering the scale of the predictor and outcome?
4. When comparing nested models via AIC/BIC, does the more complex model provide substantially better fit, or is the simpler model preferred by parsimony?
5. For survival analysis, is the proportional hazards assumption met throughout the follow-up period, or do Schoenfeld residuals suggest time-varying effects?

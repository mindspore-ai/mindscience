# Non-Coding RNA Analysis

Pipeline for identifying, annotating, and interpreting non-coding RNAs and their biological roles. Covers microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and other ncRNA classes.

**Key principles**:
1. **Class determines function** — miRNAs repress mRNA translation; lncRNAs have diverse mechanisms (scaffolds, guides, decoys, enhancers); rRNAs/tRNAs are structural
2. **Targets matter more than the ncRNA itself** — for miRNAs, the regulated mRNA targets determine the phenotype
3. **Expression context is critical** — ncRNAs are highly tissue/cell-type specific
4. **Conservation indicates function** — deeply conserved ncRNAs (miR-let-7, MALAT1) have well-established roles
5. **Evidence grading** — T1: validated targets (reporter assay, CLIP-seq), T2: high-confidence computational prediction, T3: expression correlation, T4: sequence-based prediction only

## When to Use

- "What are the targets of miR-21?"
- "Find lncRNAs associated with breast cancer"
- "Is this lncRNA conserved across species?"
- "What miRNAs regulate TP53?"
- "Annotate these non-coding RNA IDs"
- "Which miRNAs are biomarkers for [disease]?"

**Not this skill**: For mRNA expression analysis, use `tooluniverse-rnaseq-deseq2`. For CRISPR screens, use `tooluniverse-crispr-screen-analysis`.

## Workflow

```
Phase 0: ncRNA Identity & Classification
  Name/ID → miRBase/LNCipedia/RNAcentral → class, sequence, genomic location
    |
Phase 1: Target & Interaction Analysis
  miRNA → target mRNAs; lncRNA → interacting proteins/RNAs/chromatin
    |
Phase 2: Expression & Tissue Specificity
  GTEx/GEO → where is it expressed? Tissue-specific or ubiquitous?
    |
Phase 3: Disease Associations
  DisGeNET/PubMed/CTD → ncRNA-disease links with evidence
    |
Phase 4: Functional Interpretation
  Pathway enrichment of targets → biological role → clinical significance
```

### Phase 0: ncRNA Identity & Classification

| ncRNA Class | Size | Database | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| **miRNA** | ~22 nt | miRBase | Post-transcriptional gene silencing via 3'UTR binding |
| **lncRNA** | >200 nt | LNCipedia | Diverse: chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation, miRNA sponges |
| **rRNA** | 120-5000 nt | RNAcentral/Rfam | Ribosome components (translation) |
| **tRNA** | ~76 nt | RNAcentral | Amino acid delivery to ribosome |
| **snoRNA** | 60-300 nt | Rfam | rRNA modification (methylation, pseudouridylation) |
| **snRNA** | ~150 nt | Rfam | Spliceosome components (mRNA splicing) |
| **piRNA** | 26-31 nt | RNAcentral | Transposon silencing in germline |
| **circRNA** | Variable | RNAcentral | miRNA sponges, protein scaffolds |

**Identification workflow**:
- Name starts with `miR-` or `hsa-mir-` → search miRBase
- Name starts with `LINC`, `MALAT`, `HOTAIR`, `XIST`, or ends in `-AS1` → search LNCipedia
- Any ncRNA type → search RNAcentral (aggregates all databases)
- RNA family question → search Rfam

### Phase 1: Target & Interaction Analysis

**For miRNAs** — the targets determine the biology:

**NOTE**: There is no dedicated miRNA target lookup tool in ToolUniverse. To find miRNA targets:

1. **Literature search** (most reliable): `PubMed_search_articles(query="miR-21 target validation luciferase")`
2. **Cross-references**: `miRBase_get_mirna_xrefs(accession="MIMAT0000076")` — may link to external target databases
3. **Known targets for well-studied miRNAs**: Use the reference table below, then validate via STRING/Reactome
4. **For novel miRNAs**: Search PubMed for "[miRNA] target" and extract validated targets from papers

Well-studied miRNA targets (for common oncomiRs/tumor suppressors):
- **miR-21**: PTEN, PDCD4, TPM1, RECK, SPRY1, SPRY2, BTG2
- **miR-155**: SOCS1, SHIP1, AID, TP53INP1
- **miR-122**: SLC7A1, ADAM17 (also HCV IRES cofactor)
- **let-7**: RAS, HMGA2, MYC, LIN28

**Target interpretation framework**:

| Evidence Level | Method | Confidence | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Validated** | Luciferase reporter, CLIP-seq, degradome-seq | High (T1) | Base conclusions on these |
| **High-confidence prediction** | TargetScan (conserved sites), DIANA-microT (score>0.9) | Medium (T2) | Support validated findings |
| **Prediction only** | miRanda, PicTar, RNA22 | Low (T3-T4) | Hypothesis generation only |

**For lncRNAs** — the mechanism varies:

| lncRNA Mechanism | Example | How to Investigate |
|---|---|---|
| **Chromatin modifier** | HOTAIR, XIST | Check interacting proteins (PRC2, LSD1) via PubMed |
| **Transcription regulator** | NEAT1, MEG3 | Check nearby genes (cis-regulation) via genomic location |
| **miRNA sponge** | MALAT1, circRNAs | Search for miRNA binding sites |
| **Scaffold** | NKILA, BCAR4 | Check protein interactions |
| **Enhancer RNA** | eRNAs | Check ENCODE enhancer annotations |

### Phase 2: Expression & Tissue Specificity

```python
GTEx_get_median_gene_expression(gene_symbol="MIR21")  # miRNA host gene expression
# Note: GTEx measures RNA-seq; miRNA expression may need miRNA-seq data from GEO
```

**Interpretation**: Tissue-restricted ncRNAs are often functionally important in that tissue. Ubiquitous ncRNAs (like MALAT1) tend to have housekeeping roles.

### Phase 3: Disease Associations

```python
DisGeNET_search_gene(query="MIR21")  # miR-21 disease associations
PubMed_search_articles(query="miR-21 biomarker cancer")
```

**Key ncRNA-disease associations** (well-established):

| ncRNA | Disease | Role | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| miR-21 | Multiple cancers | OncomiR; targets PTEN, PDCD4, TPM1 | T1 (hundreds of studies) |
| miR-155 | B-cell lymphoma, inflammation | Immune regulation | T1 |
| miR-122 | Hepatitis C, liver disease | HCV replication cofactor; therapeutic target (miravirsen) | T1 |
| let-7 family | Lung cancer, stem cell differentiation | Tumor suppressor; targets RAS, HMGA2 | T1 |
| HOTAIR | Breast, colorectal cancer | Recruits PRC2; metastasis | T1 |
| MALAT1 | Lung cancer, metastasis | Splicing regulation, transcription | T1 |
| XIST | X-inactivation, cancer | Chromatin silencing | T1 |
| NEAT1 | Paraspeckle formation, cancer | Nuclear body scaffold | T2 |
| H19 | Beckwith-Wiedemann, cancer | Imprinted lncRNA; miR-675 host | T1 |
| ANRIL | CVD, diabetes, cancer | CDKN2A/B locus regulation | T1 (GWAS) |

### Phase 4: Functional Interpretation

After identifying miRNA targets (Phase 1), run pathway enrichment:

```python
# Collect validated target gene symbols
targets = ["PTEN", "PDCD4", "TPM1", "RECK", "SPRY1"]  # miR-21 targets

# Pathway enrichment
ReactomeAnalysis_pathway_enrichment(identifiers="PTEN PDCD4 TPM1 RECK SPRY1")
STRING_get_network(identifiers="PTEN\rPDCD4\rTPM1\rRECK\rSPRY1", species=9606)
```

**Interpretation**: If miR-21 targets are enriched in apoptosis and PI3K-AKT signaling → miR-21 is an oncomiR that promotes survival by simultaneously suppressing multiple tumor suppressors.

**Report structure**:
1. **ncRNA Identity** — class, sequence, genomic location, conservation
2. **Targets/Interactions** — validated targets with evidence grades
3. **Expression Profile** — tissue specificity, disease-specific expression changes
4. **Disease Associations** — evidence-graded disease links
5. **Pathway Analysis** — enriched pathways among targets
6. **Mechanistic Model** — how this ncRNA contributes to disease biology
7. **Clinical Potential** — biomarker utility, therapeutic target potential (antagomirs, ASOs)

## Limitations

### Computational Procedure: TargetScan Predicted Targets (Download-and-Process)

TargetScan provides the best computational miRNA target predictions but has no REST API. Download and process locally:

```python
# Step 1: Download TargetScan predicted targets (one-time, ~10MB zipped)
# URL: https://www.targetscan.org/vert_80/vert_80_data_download/Summary_Counts.default_predictions.txt.zip
import pandas as pd
import zipfile, io, requests

url = "https://www.targetscan.org/vert_80/vert_80_data_download/Summary_Counts.default_predictions.txt.zip"
resp = requests.get(url, timeout=60)
with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(resp.content)) as z:
    fname = z.namelist()[0]
    df = pd.read_csv(z.open(fname), sep='\t')

# Step 2: Query for a specific miRNA family
mirna = "miR-21-5p"  # or "miR-21/590-5p" (TargetScan uses family names)
targets = df[df['miRNA Family'].str.contains("miR-21", case=False, na=False)]

# Step 3: Rank by cumulative weighted context++ score
targets_ranked = targets.sort_values('Cumulative weighted context++ score', ascending=True)
print(f"Top 20 predicted targets of {mirna}:")
for _, row in targets_ranked.head(20).iterrows():
    print(f"  {row['Target Gene']:10s} score={row['Cumulative weighted context++ score']:.3f}  "
          f"sites={row['Total num conserved sites']}")
```

**Interpretation**: More negative context++ score = stronger predicted repression. Conserved sites (>1) are higher confidence.

### Computational Procedure: miRTarBase Validated Targets (Download-and-Process)

miRTarBase has Cloudflare protection blocking programmatic access. Use the R/Bioconductor data package or bulk download:

```python
# Option 1: Download from miRTarBase bulk export (requires browser download first)
# Go to: https://mirtarbase.cuhk.edu.cn/~miRTarBase/miRTarBase_2025/
# Download: hsa_MTI.xlsx (human miRNA-target interactions)

# Option 2: Use the GitHub data dump
# https://github.com/jorainer/mirtarbase — R package with cached data

# Once you have the file:
import pandas as pd
mti = pd.read_excel("hsa_MTI.xlsx")  # or read_csv if TSV

# Filter for your miRNA
mir21_targets = mti[mti['miRNA'].str.contains('hsa-miR-21', case=False, na=False)]
print(f"miR-21 validated targets: {len(mir21_targets)}")

# Filter by evidence strength
strong = mir21_targets[mir21_targets['Support Type'].str.contains(
    'Luciferase|Reporter|Western|CLIP', case=False, na=False
)]
print(f"  Strong evidence (reporter/CLIP): {len(strong)}")
for _, row in strong.head(10).iterrows():
    print(f"    {row['Target Gene']:10s} — {row['Support Type']}")
```

**When download is not available**: Use the built-in reference table in Phase 1 for well-studied miRNAs, or search PubMed for validated targets.

## Limitations

- **miRNA target prediction is noisy** — even the best algorithms have >50% false positive rates; always prioritize experimentally validated targets
- **lncRNA function is poorly characterized** — only ~5% of annotated lncRNAs have known functions
- **Expression measurement varies** — miRNA-seq, RNA-seq, and microarray capture different ncRNA classes; check the assay type
- **Species differences** — miRNAs are often conserved but lncRNAs are frequently species-specific; cross-species lncRNA comparisons are unreliable

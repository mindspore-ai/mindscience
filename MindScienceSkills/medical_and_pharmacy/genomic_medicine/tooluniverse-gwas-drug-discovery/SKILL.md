# GWAS-to-Drug Target Discovery

Transform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into actionable drug targets and repurposing opportunities.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English terms in tool calls. Respond in the user's language.

---

## Overview

This skill bridges genetic discoveries from GWAS with drug development by:

1. **Identifying genetic risk factors** - Finding genes associated with diseases
2. **Assessing druggability** - Evaluating which genes can be targeted by drugs
3. **Prioritizing targets** - Ranking candidates by genetic evidence strength
4. **Finding existing drugs** - Discovering approved/investigational compounds
5. **Identifying repurposing opportunities** - Matching drugs to new indications

**Key insight**: Targets with genetic support have 2x higher probability of clinical approval (Nelson et al., Nature Genetics 2015).

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: GWAS Gene Discovery

**Input**: Disease/trait name (e.g., "type 2 diabetes", "Alzheimer disease")

**Process**: Query GWAS Catalog for associations, filter by significance (p < 5x10^-8), map variants to genes, aggregate evidence.

**Tools**:
- `gwas_get_associations_for_trait` - Get associations by disease
- `gwas_search_associations` - Flexible search
- `gwas_get_associations_for_snp` - SNP-specific associations
- `OpenTargets_search_gwas_studies_by_disease` - Curated GWAS data
- `OpenTargets_get_variant_credible_sets` - Fine-mapped loci with L2G predictions

### Step 2: Druggability Assessment

**Input**: Gene list from Step 1

**Process**: Check target class, assess tractability, evaluate safety, check for tool compounds or structures.

**Tools**:
- `OpenTargets_get_target_tractability_by_ensemblID` - Druggability assessment
- `OpenTargets_get_target_classes_by_ensemblID` - Target classification
- `OpenTargets_get_target_safety_profile_by_ensemblID` - Safety data
- `OpenTargets_get_target_genomic_location_by_ensemblID` - Genomic context

### Step 3: Target Prioritization

**Scoring Formula**:
```
Target Score = (GWAS Score x 0.4) + (Druggability x 0.3) + (Clinical Evidence x 0.2) + (Novelty x 0.1)
```

Rank targets by composite score. Generate target dossiers.

### Step 4: Existing Drug Search

**Process**: Search drug-target associations, find approved drugs and clinical candidates, get MOA and indication data.

**Tools**:
- `OpenTargets_get_associated_drugs_by_disease_efoId` - Known drugs for disease
- `OpenTargets_get_drug_mechanisms_of_action_by_chemblId` - Drug MOA
- `ChEMBL_get_target_activities` - Bioactivity data
- `ChEMBL_get_drug_mechanisms` / `ChEMBL_search_drugs` - Drug data

### Step 5: Clinical Evidence & Safety

**Tools**:
- `FDA_get_adverse_reactions_by_drug_name` - Safety data
- `FDA_get_active_ingredient_info_by_drug_name` - Drug composition
- `OpenTargets_get_drug_warnings_by_chemblId` - Drug warnings

### Step 6: Repurposing Opportunities

Match drug targets to new disease genes, assess mechanistic fit, check contraindications, estimate repurposing probability.

## Quick Start

```python
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse
tu = ToolUniverse(use_cache=True)
tu.load_tools()

# Step 1: Get GWAS associations (use disease_trait not trait; no p_value_threshold param)
associations = tu.tools.gwas_get_associations_for_trait(disease_trait="type 2 diabetes")

# Step 2: Assess druggability (ensemblId lowercase d)
tractability = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_target_tractability_by_ensemblID(ensemblId="ENSG00000148737")

# Step 3: Find existing drugs per target via DGIdb (OpenTargets drug query may return HTTP 400)
drugs = tu.tools.DGIdb_get_drug_gene_interactions(genes=["TCF7L2"])
```

## Best Practices

1. **Multi-ancestry GWAS**: Include trans-ethnic meta-analyses for robust signals
2. **Functional validation**: Confirm with eQTL, pQTL, colocalization analysis
3. **Network analysis**: Group GWAS hits by pathway (KEGG, Reactome)
4. **Safety assessment**: Check gnomAD pLI, GTEx expression, PharmaGKB
5. **Batch operations**: Use `tu.run_batch()` for parallel queries across targets

## Parameter Gotchas

| Issue | Wrong | Correct |
|-------|-------|---------|
| GWAS trait param | `gwas_get_associations_for_trait(trait=...)` | `disease_trait=...` (no `trait` param exists) |
| GWAS p-value filter | `p_value_threshold=5e-8` | No such param; filter client-side after fetching results |
| OpenTargets ensembl case | `ensemblID="ENSG..."` | `ensemblId="ENSG..."` (lowercase 'd') |
| ClinicalTrials tool name | `ClinicalTrials_search(...)` | `ClinicalTrials_search_studies(...)` |
| DGIdb tool name | `DGIdb_get_interactions(...)` | `DGIdb_get_drug_gene_interactions(genes=[...])` |
| OpenTargets disease drugs | `OpenTargets_get_associated_drugs_by_disease_efoId` may return HTTP 400 | Fall back to `DGIdb_get_drug_gene_interactions` per gene |
| GWAS study search param | `gwas_search_studies(disease_trait=...)` | Use `efo_trait=...` for studies (disease_trait works for associations only) |

## Interpretation: From GWAS Hit to Drug Target

### GWAS Signal Strength Assessment

| Signal Quality | Criteria | Drug Discovery Value |
|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Gold standard** | Genome-wide significant (p < 5e-8), replicated across ancestries, L2G > 0.5, eQTL colocalized | Highest priority — genetic causality established |
| **Strong** | Genome-wide significant, L2G > 0.3, biological plausibility | High priority — pursue with functional validation |
| **Moderate** | Suggestive (p < 1e-5), or significant but no fine-mapping | Medium — needs additional evidence before investment |
| **Weak** | Single study, no replication, low L2G, no functional support | Low — hypothesis generating only |

### Target Prioritization Decision Tree

After identifying GWAS-linked genes, rank them by answering:

1. **Is the gene druggable?** (DGIdb category: kinase/GPCR/ion channel = yes; transcription factor/scaffold = harder)
   - If approved drug exists → **REPURPOSING** opportunity (fastest path)
   - If druggable but no drug → **NOVEL TARGET** (standard drug discovery)
   - If not druggable → consider antisense/PROTAC/genetic medicine

2. **Is the genetic direction clear?**
   - LOF variants increase disease risk → need an AGONIST or gene therapy
   - GOF variants increase disease risk → need an INHIBITOR (typical small molecule)
   - Direction unclear → need functional studies before drug design

3. **What's the effect size?** (Odds ratio from GWAS)
   - OR > 2.0: strong effect, likely penetrant → Mendelian-like, high confidence
   - OR 1.2-2.0: moderate, common in complex disease → validate with independent data
   - OR < 1.2: small effect → may not be clinically meaningful alone

4. **Is there clinical precedent?**
   - Drug for same target approved for ANY disease → safety data exists → lower risk
   - Drug in clinical trials → partial de-risking
   - No precedent → full de novo development risk

### Evidence Integration Table

For the final report, score each GWAS-to-target candidate:

| Criterion | Score 3 | Score 2 | Score 1 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| GWAS signal | Replicated, multi-ancestry | Single study, significant | Suggestive only |
| L2G / fine-mapping | L2G > 0.5, credible set < 5 variants | L2G 0.2-0.5 | L2G < 0.2 or no fine-mapping |
| Druggability | Approved drug or probe exists | Tractable (binding site known) | Not classically druggable |
| Direction of effect | Clear LOF/GOF with consistent direction | Ambiguous | Unknown |
| Safety | pLI < 0.5, not expressed in heart/brain | pLI 0.5-0.9 | pLI > 0.9 (essential gene) |

**Max score 15**: 12-15 = priority target; 8-11 = worth investigating; <8 = deprioritize.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No GWAS hits for disease | Try broader trait name, check synonyms, use OpenTargets |
| Gene not in druggable class | Consider antibody/antisense modalities, check pathway neighbors |
| No existing drugs for target | Target may be novel - check tool compounds in ChEMBL |
| Low L2G score | Variants may be regulatory - check eQTL/pQTL evidence |

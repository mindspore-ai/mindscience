name: tooluniverse-pathway-disease-genetics
description: Connect GWAS variants to biological pathways for drug target discovery. Maps disease-associated SNPs to causal genes via eQTL colocalization (GTEx), links genes to enriched pathways (Reactome, KEGG, MetaCyc), and identifies druggable targets within disease-relevant pathways. Use when asked to translate GWAS findings into mechanistic insights, find pathways enriched for disease genes, discover drug targets from genetic evidence, or answer questions like "What pathways are disrupted in type 2 diabetes based on GWAS data?"

# Pathway-Disease Genetics: GWAS to Drug Targets via Pathways

Connect genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants to biological pathways for mechanistic understanding and drug target discovery.

## When to Use

Apply when user asks:
- "What pathways are disrupted in [disease] based on GWAS?"
- "Which GWAS genes for [trait] are in druggable pathways?"
- "Map [SNP/variant] to its causal gene and pathway"
- "Find drug targets from GWAS data for [disease]"
- "What is the eQTL evidence for [gene] in [tissue]?"
- "Which pathways are enriched for [disease] risk genes?"

## Tool Inventory (Verified Names)

### GWAS Catalog Tools
| Tool | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `gwas_search_associations` | Search GWAS associations by keyword | `query` |
| `gwas_get_variants_for_trait` | Get variants for a trait | `trait`, `p_value_threshold` (optional) |

| `gwas_search_snps` | Search SNPs by various criteria | `query` |

**GWAS tool notes:**
- `gwas_get_associations_for_trait`: BROKEN -- use `gwas_search_associations(query=trait)` instead
- `gwas_get_variants_for_trait` now accepts `p_value_threshold` for server-side filtering
- Client-side p-value filtering is also applied when the API returns unfiltered results
- Response: `{data: [{...}], metadata: {...}}`

### Open Targets Genetics
| Tool | Purpose | Key Parameters |

| `OpenTargets_multi_entity_search_by_query_string` | Search for disease/gene/drug | `queryString` (NOT `query`) |

**Open Targets notes:**
- Disease IDs: Use EFO/MONDO format (e.g., `MONDO_0005148` for T2D, NOT `EFO_0001360`)
- Gene IDs: Use Ensembl format (e.g., `ENSG00000148737` for TCF7L2)
- `OpenTargets_multi_entity_search_by_query_string` resolves names to IDs

### GTEx eQTL Tools
| Tool | Purpose | Key Parameters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `GTEx_query_eqtl` | Query eQTLs for gene/variant/tissue | `gene_input`, `tissue`, `variant_id` |

| `GTEx_get_median_gene_expression` | Median expression by tissue | `gencode_id` (VERSIONED, array), `tissue_site_detail_id` (array) |

**GTEx notes:**
- All GTEx tools are SOAP-style, require `operation` parameter
- Use `gencode_id` with version (e.g., `ENSG00000148737.11`)
- `tissue_site_detail_id` uses specific GTEx tissue names (e.g., `Pancreas`, `Liver`)
- Always use `gtex_v8` (v10 returns empty for medianGeneExpression)
- `gene_input` must not be empty (causes silent API failure)

### Reactome Pathway Tools

Phase 0: Disease/Trait Resolution
  -> OpenTargets_multi_entity_search_by_query_string(queryString=<disease_name>)
  -> Get: EFO/MONDO disease ID, standardized name

Phase 1: Collect GWAS Signals
  -> gwas_search_associations(query=<disease_name>)
  -> gwas_get_variants_for_trait(trait=<trait>, p_value_threshold=5e-8)
  -> OpenTargets_search_gwas_studies_by_disease(efoId=<disease_id>)
  -> Collect: lead SNPs, p-values, mapped genes, study IDs

Phase 2: Variant Annotation
  -> For each lead SNP:
     -> EnsemblVEP_annotate_rsid(variant_id=<rsid>)
     -> Get: consequence type, nearest gene, regulatory features
     -> Classify: coding (missense/nonsense) vs non-coding (regulatory/intronic)

Phase 3: eQTL Evidence (GTEx)
  -> For each lead SNP or mapped gene:
     -> GTEx_query_eqtl(gene_input=<gene>, tissue=<relevant_tissue>)
     -> GTEx_get_expression_summary(gene_input=<gene>)
  -> Identify: Which tissue shows strongest eQTL effect?
  -> Colocalization logic:
     - GWAS SNP is also significant eQTL for gene G in tissue T
     - Direction of effect: risk allele increases or decreases expression?
     - Tissue relevance: Is tissue T biologically relevant to disease?

Phase 4: Gene Prioritization
  -> For genes with eQTL support:
     -> OpenTargets_target_disease_evidence(ensemblId=<gene_ensembl>, efoId=<disease_id>)
     -> Score by: GWAS p-value x eQTL significance x tissue relevance
  -> Rank genes by combined evidence score

Phase 5: Gene-to-Target Assessment
  -> DGIdb_get_gene_druggability(genes=[<gene_list>])
  -> DGIdb_get_drug_gene_interactions(genes=[<gene_list>])
  -> OpenTargets_get_associated_drugs_by_target_ensemblID(ensemblId=...)
  -> Classify: druggable (existing drugs), tractable (predicted druggable), undruggable

Phase 6: Summary
  -> Table: Gene | GWAS p-value | eQTL tissue | eQTL p-value | Direction | Druggability
  -> Highlight top causal gene candidates with eQTL + druggability evidence
```

### Evidence Confidence Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **High** | GWAS p < 5e-8 + eQTL colocalizes in disease-relevant tissue + coding variant or L2G > 0.5 |
| **Medium** | GWAS p < 5e-8 + eQTL in any tissue OR multiple independent GWAS signals at locus |
| **Low** | GWAS p < 5e-8 + positional mapping only (nearest gene) |

## Limitations

1. **eQTL colocalization is not formal colocalization analysis**: GTEx eQTL lookup shows whether a variant is an eQTL, but does not perform statistical colocalization (coloc/ENLOC). Interpret as suggestive, not definitive
2. **GWAS Catalog coverage**: Not all published GWAS are curated; recent studies may be missing
3. **Pathway database overlap**: Reactome and KEGG have different pathway definitions; some biology covered in one but not the other
4. **Druggability prediction limitations**: DGIdb categories are heuristic; "undruggable" does not mean the gene cannot be targeted with novel modalities
5. **GTEx tissue specificity**: eQTLs are tissue-specific; querying wrong tissue may miss causal effects
6. **KEGG organism param**: Silently ignored if format is wrong; use organism code like "hsa"

# GWAS Trait-to-Gene Discovery

**Discover genes associated with diseases and traits using genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**

## Overview

This skill enables systematic discovery of genes linked to diseases/traits by analyzing GWAS data from two major resources:
- **GWAS Catalog** (EBI/NHGRI): Curated catalog of published GWAS with >500,000 associations
- **Open Targets Genetics**: Fine-mapped GWAS signals with locus-to-gene (L2G) predictions

## Use Cases

**Clinical Research**
- "What genes are associated with type 2 diabetes?"
- "Find genetic risk factors for coronary artery disease"
- "Which genes contribute to Alzheimer's disease susceptibility?"

**Drug Target Discovery**
- Identify genes with strong genetic evidence for disease causation
- Prioritize targets based on L2G scores and replication across studies
- Find genes with genome-wide significant associations (p < 5e-8)

**Functional Genomics**
- Map disease-associated variants to candidate genes
- Analyze genetic architecture of complex traits
- Understand polygenic disease mechanisms

## Workflow

```
1. Trait Search → Search GWAS Catalog by disease/trait name
       ↓
2. SNP Aggregation → Collect genome-wide significant SNPs (p < 5e-8)
       ↓
3. Gene Mapping → Extract mapped genes from associations
       ↓
4. Evidence Ranking → Score by p-value, replication, fine-mapping
       ↓
5. Annotation (Optional) → Add L2G predictions from Open Targets
```

## Key Concepts

**Genome-wide Significance**
- Standard threshold: p < 5×10⁻⁸
- Accounts for multiple testing burden across ~1M common variants
- Higher confidence: p < 5×10⁻¹⁰ or replicated across studies

**Gene Mapping Methods**
- **Positional**: Nearest gene to lead SNP
- **Fine-mapping**: Statistical refinement to credible variants
- **Locus-to-Gene (L2G)**: Integrative score combining multiple evidence types

**Evidence Confidence Levels**
- **High**: L2G score > 0.5 OR multiple studies with p < 5e-10
- **Medium**: 2+ studies with p < 5e-8
- **Low**: Single study or marginal significance

    {
      "symbol": str,              # Gene symbol (e.g., "TCF7L2")
      "min_p_value": float,       # Most significant p-value

## Example Results

**Type 2 Diabetes**
```
TCF7L2:  p=1.2e-98, 15 studies, L2G=0.82 → High confidence
KCNJ11:  p=3.4e-67, 12 studies, L2G=0.76 → High confidence
PPARG:   p=2.1e-45, 8 studies,  L2G=0.71 → High confidence

```

**Alzheimer's Disease**
```
APOE:    p=1.0e-450, 25 studies, L2G=0.95 → High confidence
BIN1:    p=2.3e-89,  18 studies, L2G=0.88 → High confidence
CLU:     p=4.5e-67,  16 studies, L2G=0.82 → High confidence
ABCA7:   p=6.7e-54,  14 studies, L2G=0.79 → High confidence
CR1:     p=8.9e-52,  13 studies, L2G=0.75 → High confidence
```

## Best Practices

**1. Use Disease Ontology IDs for Precision**
```
# Instead of:
discover_gwas_genes("diabetes")  # Ambiguous

# Use:
discover_gwas_genes(
    "type 2 diabetes",
    disease_ontology_id="MONDO_0005148"  # Specific
)
```

**2. Filter by Evidence Strength**
```
# For drug targets, require strong evidence:
discover_gwas_genes(
    "coronary artery disease",
    p_value_threshold=5e-10,    # Stricter than GWAS threshold
    min_evidence_count=3,       # Multiple independent studies
    use_fine_mapping=True       # Include L2G predictions
)
```

**3. Interpret Results Carefully**
- **Association ≠ Causation**: GWAS identifies correlated variants, not necessarily causal genes
- **Linkage Disequilibrium**: Lead SNP may tag the true causal variant in a nearby gene
- **Fine-mapping**: L2G scores provide better causal gene evidence than positional mapping
- **Functional Evidence**: Validate with orthogonal data (eQTLs, knockout models, etc.)

## Tool-Specific Notes (Updated)

### `gwas_get_variants_for_trait` -- p-value Filtering

This tool now accepts an optional `p_value_threshold` parameter for server-side
p-value filtering. When provided, the GWAS Catalog API filters variants to only
return those below the specified threshold.

```python
# Server-side filtering (preferred -- reduces data transfer)
result = tu.tools.gwas_get_variants_for_trait(
    trait="type 2 diabetes",
    p_value_threshold=5e-8
)
```

**Client-side fallback**: When the API returns unfiltered results (some trait
queries ignore the threshold parameter), the tool also applies client-side
p-value filtering. This means you may see fewer results than expected if the
API returned pre-filtered data and the client filter applies again. Always
check the actual p-values in the returned data.

### `gwas_get_associations_for_trait` -- BROKEN

This tool returns errors for most queries. Use `gwas_search_associations(query=<trait>)`
as a reliable alternative. The response format is `{data: [{...}], metadata: {...}}`.

### `gwas_get_snps_for_gene` -- Parameter Rename

The parameter was renamed from `mapped_gene` to `gene_symbol` for clarity. Use:
```python
result = tu.tools.gwas_get_snps_for_gene(gene_symbol="TCF7L2")
```

## Limitations

1. **Gene Mapping Uncertainty**
   - Positional mapping assigns SNPs to nearest gene (may be incorrect)
   - Fine-mapping available for only a subset of studies
   - Intergenic variants difficult to map

2. **Population Bias**
   - Most GWAS in European populations
   - Effect sizes may differ across ancestries
   - Rare variants often under-represented

3. **Sample Size Dependence**
   - Larger studies detect more associations
   - Older small studies may have false negatives
   - p-values alone don't indicate effect size

4. **Validation Bug**
   - Some ToolUniverse tools have oneOf validation issues
   - Use `validate=False` parameter if needed
   - This is automatically handled in the Python implementation

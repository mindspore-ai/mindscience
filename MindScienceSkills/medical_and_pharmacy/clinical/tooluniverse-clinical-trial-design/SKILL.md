# Clinical Trial Design Feasibility Assessment

Systematically assess clinical trial feasibility by analyzing 6 research dimensions. Produces comprehensive feasibility reports with quantitative enrollment projections, endpoint recommendations, and regulatory pathway analysis.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English terms in tool calls (drug names, disease names, biomarker names), even if the user writes in another language. Only try original-language terms as a fallback if English returns no results. Respond in the user's language.

## Core Principles

### 1. Report-First Approach (MANDATORY)
**DO NOT** show tool outputs to user. Instead:
1. Create `[INDICATION]_trial_feasibility_report.md` FIRST
2. Initialize with all section headers
3. Progressively update as data arrives
4. Present only the final report

### 2. Evidence Grading System

| Grade | Symbol | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| **A** | 3-star | Regulatory acceptance, multiple precedents | FDA-approved endpoint in same indication |
| **B** | 2-star | Clinical validation, single precedent | Phase 3 trial in related indication |
| **C** | 1-star | Preclinical or exploratory | Phase 1 use, biomarker validation ongoing |
| **D** | 0-star | Proposed, no validation | Novel endpoint, no precedent |

### 3. Feasibility Score (0-100)
Weighted composite score:
- **Patient Availability** (30%): Population size x biomarker prevalence x geography
- **Endpoint Precedent** (25%): Historical use, regulatory acceptance
- **Regulatory Clarity** (20%): Pathway defined, precedents exist
- **Comparator Feasibility** (15%): Standard of care availability
- **Safety Monitoring** (10%): Known risks, monitoring established

**Interpretation**: >=75 HIGH (proceed), 50-74 MODERATE (additional validation), <50 LOW (de-risking required)

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when users:
- Plan early-phase trials (Phase 1/2 emphasis)
- Need enrollment feasibility assessment
- Design biomarker-selected trials
- Evaluate endpoint strategies
- Assess regulatory pathways
- Compare trial design options
- Need safety monitoring plans

**Trigger phrases**: "clinical trial design", "trial feasibility", "enrollment projections", "endpoint selection", "trial planning", "Phase 1/2 design", "basket trial", "biomarker trial"

## Core Strategy: 6 Research Paths

Execute 6 parallel research dimensions. See `STUDY_DESIGN_PROCEDURES.md` for detailed steps per path.

```
Trial Design Query
|
+-- PATH 1: Patient Population Sizing
|   Disease prevalence, biomarker prevalence, geographic distribution,
|   eligibility criteria impact, enrollment projections
|
+-- PATH 2: Biomarker Prevalence & Testing
|   Mutation frequency, testing availability, turnaround time,
|   cost/reimbursement, alternative biomarkers
|
+-- PATH 3: Comparator Selection
|   Standard of care, approved comparators, historical controls,
|   placebo appropriateness, combination therapy
|
+-- PATH 4: Endpoint Selection
|   Primary endpoint precedents, FDA acceptance history,
|   measurement feasibility, surrogate vs clinical endpoints
|
+-- PATH 5: Safety Endpoints & Monitoring
|   Mechanism-based toxicity, class effects, organ-specific monitoring,
|   DLT history, safety monitoring plan
|
+-- PATH 6: Regulatory Pathway
    Regulatory precedents (505(b)(1), 505(b)(2)), breakthrough therapy,
    orphan drug, fast track, FDA guidance
```

## Report Structure (14 Sections)

Create `[INDICATION]_trial_feasibility_report.md` with all 14 sections. See `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` for full templates with fillable fields.

1. **Executive Summary** - Feasibility score, key findings, go/no-go recommendation
2. **Disease Background** - Prevalence, incidence, SOC, unmet need
3. **Patient Population Analysis** - Base population, biomarker selection, eligibility funnel, enrollment projections
4. **Biomarker Strategy** - Primary biomarker, alternatives, testing logistics
5. **Endpoint Selection & Justification** - Primary/secondary/exploratory endpoints, statistical considerations
6. **Comparator Analysis** - SOC, trial design options (single-arm vs randomized vs non-inferiority), drug sourcing
7. **Safety Endpoints & Monitoring Plan** - DLT definition, mechanism-based toxicities, organ monitoring, SMC
8. **Study Design Recommendations** - Phase, design type, schema, eligibility, treatment plan, assessment schedule
9. **Enrollment & Site Strategy** - Site selection, enrollment projections, recruitment strategies
10. **Regulatory Pathway** - FDA pathway, precedents, pre-IND meeting, IND timeline
11. **Budget & Resource Considerations** - Cost drivers, timeline, FTE requirements
12. **Risk Assessment** - Feasibility risks, scientific risks, mitigation strategies
13. **Success Criteria & Go/No-Go Decision** - Phase 1/2 criteria, interim analysis, feasibility scorecard
14. **Recommendations & Next Steps** - Final recommendation, critical path to IND, alternative designs

# Drug Repurposing with ToolUniverse

Systematically identify and evaluate drug repurposing candidates using multiple computational strategies.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English terms in tool calls. Respond in the user's language.

---

## Core Strategies

1. **Target-Based**: Disease targets -> Find drugs that modulate those targets
2. **Compound-Based**: Approved drugs -> Find new disease indications
3. **Disease-Driven**: Disease -> Targets -> Match to existing drugs

---

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Disease & Target Analysis
  Get disease info (OpenTargets), find associated targets, get target details

Phase 2: Drug Discovery
  Search DrugBank, DGIdb, ChEMBL for drugs targeting disease-associated genes
  Get drug details, indications, pharmacology

Phase 3: Safety & Feasibility Assessment
  FDA warnings, FAERS adverse events, drug interactions, ADMET predictions

Phase 4: Literature Evidence
  PubMed, Europe PMC, clinical trials for existing evidence

Phase 5: Scoring & Ranking
  Composite score: target association + safety + literature + drug properties
```

See: PROCEDURES.md for detailed step-by-step procedures and code patterns.

## Quick Start

```python
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse
tu = ToolUniverse()
tu.load_tools()

# Step 1: Get disease targets
disease_info = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_disease_id_description_by_name(diseaseName="rheumatoid arthritis")
# Response nests ID at data.search.hits[0].id
disease_id = disease_info['data']['search']['hits'][0]['id']
targets = tu.tools.OpenTargets_get_associated_targets_by_disease_efoId(efoId=disease_id, limit=10)

# Step 2: Find drugs for each target
# Response nests targets at data.disease.associatedTargets.rows
rows = targets['data']['disease']['associatedTargets']['rows']
for target in rows[:5]:
    gene = target['target']['approvedSymbol']
    drugs = tu.tools.DGIdb_get_drug_gene_interactions(genes=[gene])
```

## Key ToolUniverse Tools

**Disease & Target**:
- `OpenTargets_get_disease_id_description_by_name` - Disease lookup
- `OpenTargets_get_associated_targets_by_disease_efoId` - Disease targets
- `UniProt_get_entry_by_accession` - Protein details

**Drug Discovery**:
- `drugbank_get_drug_name_and_description_by_target_name` - Drugs by target. **Param: `query=` (NOT `target_name=`)**
- `drugbank_get_drug_name_and_description_by_indication` - Drugs by indication. **Param: `query=` (NOT `indication=`)**
- `DGIdb_get_drug_gene_interactions` - Drug-gene interactions. Response path: `data.data.genes.nodes[0].interactions`
- `ChEMBL_search_drugs` / `ChEMBL_get_drug_mechanisms` - Drug search and MOA

**Drug Information** (ALL DrugBank tools use `query=` as the search parameter, plus `case_sensitive=False`, `exact_match=False`, `limit=N`):
- `drugbank_get_drug_basic_info_by_drug_name_or_id` - Basic info. **Param: `query="drug_name"`**
- `drugbank_get_indications_by_drug_name_or_drugbank_id` - Approved indications. **Param: `query="drug_name"`**
- `drugbank_get_pharmacology_by_drug_name_or_drugbank_id` - Pharmacology. **Param: `query="drug_name"`**
- `drugbank_get_targets_by_drug_name_or_drugbank_id` - Drug targets. **Param: `query="drug_name"`**

**Safety**:
- `FDA_get_warnings_and_cautions_by_drug_name` - FDA warnings
- `FAERS_search_reports_by_drug_and_reaction` - Adverse events. **Param: `medicinalproduct=` (NOT `drug_name=`)**

- `CTD_get_gene_diseases` - Curated gene-disease associations. **Param: `input_terms="gene_symbol"` (NOT `gene_symbol=`)**

**Literature & Clinical Trials**:
- `PubMed_search_articles` / `EuropePMC_search_articles` - Literature search
- `search_clinical_trials` - ClinicalTrials.gov search. Use `condition` for disease name. The `intervention` filter is strict and may miss trials — use `query_term` for broader drug-name matching as fallback.

> **CNS diseases note**: For neurological indications (ALS, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's), prioritize BBB-penetrant candidates. Use ChEMBL molecular properties (MW < 500, PSA < 90) as BBB proxy since `ADMETAI_predict_BBB_penetrance` may require the `tooluniverse[ml]` extra. Consider route of administration (oral preferred for patients with swallowing difficulty) and sex-specific effects from preclinical models.

## Scoring & Decision Framework

### Repurposing Viability Score (0-100)

| Category | Points | How to Score |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Target Association** | 0-40 | **40**: Target has genetic evidence in disease (GWAS, rare variants); **25**: Target is in a disease-associated pathway (Reactome, KEGG); **15**: Target is differentially expressed in disease tissue; **5**: Target shares a GO term with disease genes |
| **Safety Profile** | 0-30 | **30**: FDA-approved drug, no black box warning, established safety record; **20**: FDA-approved with manageable warnings; **10**: Phase II+ data, acceptable safety; **0**: Preclinical only or serious safety signals |
| **Literature Evidence** | 0-20 | **20**: Phase II+ trial for the new indication exists; **15**: Case reports or retrospective studies show efficacy; **10**: Preclinical in-vivo evidence (animal models); **5**: In-vitro evidence only; **0**: No prior evidence |
| **Drug Properties** | 0-10 | **10**: Oral, good bioavailability, IP available; **5**: Injectable or narrow therapeutic window; **0**: Poor PK or formulation challenges |

**Classification**:
- **80-100**: Strong candidate — proceed to clinical evaluation
- **60-79**: Promising — worth preclinical validation or retrospective study
- **40-59**: Speculative — needs significant additional evidence
- **<40**: Weak — likely not worth pursuing without new mechanistic insight

### Evidence Grading for Repurposing

| Grade | Definition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **E1 (Clinical)** | Existing clinical trial for new indication (any phase) | High priority — check trial results |
| **E2 (Epidemiological)** | Retrospective/observational data showing benefit | Moderate priority — design prospective study |
| **E3 (Preclinical)** | Animal model evidence for new indication | Standard priority — validate mechanism |
| **E4 (Computational)** | Target overlap, network proximity, or molecular similarity only | Low priority — needs experimental validation |

### How to Interpret and Combine Results

After running Phases 1-4, synthesize by answering:

1. **Is the target validated for this disease?** Check OpenTargets association score (>0.5 = strong). Cross-reference with genetic evidence (GWAS hits, rare variant studies). If target association is only pathway-level, the repurposing hypothesis is speculative.

2. **Does the drug actually hit the target at achievable doses?** Check ChEMBL IC50/Ki values. If the drug's affinity for the new target is >10x weaker than for its original target, clinical efficacy is unlikely at safe doses.

3. **What's the safety margin?** Compare the dose needed for the new indication to the approved dose. If higher doses are needed, safety data from the original indication may not apply.

4. **Is there prior clinical evidence?** A Phase II trial for the new indication (even failed) is more informative than 100 computational predictions. Check `search_clinical_trials` first.

5. **What's the competitive landscape?** If better drugs already exist for the disease, repurposing offers little value. Check DrugBank indications for approved therapies.

## Best Practices

1. **Check clinical trials FIRST**: `search_clinical_trials(condition="[disease]", intervention="[drug]")` — if a trial already exists, start there
2. **Validate targets with genetics**: Genetic evidence (GWAS, rare variants) is the strongest predictor of successful drug development
3. **Safety first**: Prioritize approved drugs with known safety profiles
4. **Dose matters**: A drug that hits a disease target at 100x its approved dose is not a repurposing candidate
5. **Mechanism over correlation**: Network proximity alone is insufficient — explain WHY the drug should work
6. **Consider IP and formulation**: Generic drugs are easier to repurpose but harder to fund trials for

### Computational Procedure: Drug-Target Dose Feasibility Check

A drug that hits a new target only at 100x its approved dose is NOT a viable repurposing candidate. Use this procedure after identifying drug-target pairs:

```python
# Drug-target dose feasibility analysis
# Uses ChEMBL bioactivity data from ToolUniverse
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse

tu = ToolUniverse()
tu.load_tools()

def check_dose_feasibility(drug_name, original_target, new_target):
    """
    Compare drug's potency at original vs new target.
    If new_target IC50 > 10x original_target IC50, flag as unlikely feasible.
    """
    # Get bioactivity for original target
    orig = tu.run_one_function({
        'name': 'ChEMBL_get_bioactivities',
        'arguments': {
            'molecule_chembl_id': drug_name,  # or search first
            'target_chembl_id': original_target,
            'limit': 10
        }
    })

    # Get bioactivity for new target
    new = tu.run_one_function({
        'name': 'ChEMBL_get_bioactivities',
        'arguments': {
            'molecule_chembl_id': drug_name,
            'target_chembl_id': new_target,
            'limit': 10
        }
    })

    # Extract IC50/Ki values and compare
    # If new target requires >10x concentration → NOT FEASIBLE at safe doses
    # If new target is within 3x → PROMISING
    # If new target is within 1x → STRONG candidate
    pass  # Parse actual values from results

# Alternative: Quick Cmax check
# If published Cmax at approved dose < IC50 for new target → NOT FEASIBLE
# Cmax data can be found in:
#   - DrugBank pharmacology section
#   - DailyMed clinical pharmacology section
#   - PubMed PK studies
```

**Key principle**: The most common reason repurposing fails is insufficient drug exposure at the new target. Always check whether the drug's concentration at approved doses reaches the IC50 for the new target.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Disease not found | Try synonyms or EFO ID lookup |
| No drugs for target | Check HUGO nomenclature, expand to pathway-level, try similar targets |
| Insufficient literature | Search drug class instead, check preclinical/animal studies |
| Safety data unavailable | Drug may not be US-approved, check EMA or clinical trial safety |

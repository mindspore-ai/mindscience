# Microscopy Image Analysis and Quantitative Imaging Data

Production-ready skill for analyzing microscopy-derived measurement data using pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, and scikit-image. Designed for BixBench imaging questions covering colony morphometry, cell counting, fluorescence quantification, regression modeling, and statistical comparisons.

**IMPORTANT**: This skill handles complex multi-workflow analysis. Most implementation details have been moved to `references/` for progressive disclosure. This document focuses on high-level decision-making and workflow orchestration.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when users:
- Have microscopy measurement data (area, circularity, intensity, cell counts) in CSV/TSV
- Ask about colony morphometry (bacterial swarming, biofilm, growth assays)
- Need statistical comparisons of imaging measurements (t-test, ANOVA, Dunnett's, Mann-Whitney)
- Ask about cell counting statistics (NeuN, DAPI, marker counts)
- Need effect size calculations (Cohen's d) and power analysis
- Want regression models (polynomial, spline) fitted to dose-response or ratio data
- Ask about model comparison (R-squared, F-statistic, AIC/BIC)
- Need Shapiro-Wilk normality testing on imaging data
- Want confidence intervals for peak predictions from fitted models
- Questions mention imaging software output (ImageJ, CellProfiler, QuPath)
- Need fluorescence intensity quantification or colocalization analysis
- Ask about image segmentation results (counts, areas, shapes)

**BixBench Coverage**: 21 questions across 4 projects (bix-18, bix-19, bix-41, bix-54)

**NOT for** (use other skills instead):
- Phylogenetic analysis → Use `tooluniverse-phylogenetics`
- RNA-seq differential expression → Use `tooluniverse-rnaseq-deseq2`
- Single-cell scRNA-seq → Use `tooluniverse-single-cell`
- Statistical regression only (no imaging context) → Use `tooluniverse-statistical-modeling`

---

## Core Principles

1. **Data-first approach** - Load and inspect all CSV/TSV measurement data before analysis
2. **Question-driven** - Parse the exact statistic, comparison, or model requested
3. **Statistical rigor** - Proper effect sizes, multiple comparison corrections, model selection
4. **Imaging-aware** - Understand ImageJ/CellProfiler measurement columns (Area, Circularity, Round, Intensity)
5. **Workflow flexibility** - Support both pre-quantified data (CSV) and raw image processing
6. **Precision** - Match expected answer format (integer, range, decimal places)
7. **Reproducible** - Use standard Python/scipy equivalents to R functions

## Quantitative Data Analysis Workflow

### Phase 0: Question Parsing and Data Discovery

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before writing ANY code, identify what data files are available and what the question is asking for.

```python
import os, glob, pandas as pd

# Discover data files
data_dir = "."
csv_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_dir, '**', '*.csv'), recursive=True)
tsv_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_dir, '**', '*.tsv'), recursive=True)
img_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(data_dir, '**', '*.tif*'), recursive=True)

# Load and inspect first measurement file
if csv_files:
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_files[0])
    print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
    print(f"Columns: {list(df.columns)}")
    print(df.head())
    print(df.describe())
```

**Common Column Names**:
- Area: Colony or cell area in pixels or calibrated units
- Circularity: 4*pi*area/perimeter^2, range [0,1], 1.0 = perfect circle
- Round: Roundness = 4*area/(pi*major_axis^2)
- Genotype/Strain: Biological grouping variable
- Ratio: Co-culture mixing ratio (e.g., "1:3", "5:1")
- NeuN/DAPI/GFP: Cell marker counts or intensities

### Phase 1: Grouped Statistics

```python
def grouped_summary(df, group_cols, measure_col):
    """Calculate summary statistics by group."""
    summary = df.groupby(group_cols)[measure_col].agg(
        Mean='mean',
        SD='std',
        Median='median',
        Min='min',
        Max='max',
        N='count'
    ).reset_index()
    summary['SEM'] = summary['SD'] / np.sqrt(summary['N'])
    return summary

# Example: Colony morphometry by genotype
area_summary = grouped_summary(df, 'Genotype', 'Area')
circ_summary = grouped_summary(df, 'Genotype', 'Circularity')
```

For detailed statistical functions, see: **references/statistical_analysis.md**

### Phase 2: Statistical Testing

**Decision guide**:
- Normality test needed? → Shapiro-Wilk
- Two groups comparison? → t-test or Mann-Whitney
- Multiple groups vs control? → Dunnett's test
- Multiple groups, all comparisons? → Tukey HSD
- Two factors? → Two-way ANOVA
- Effect size? → Cohen's d
- Sample size planning? → Power analysis

See: **references/statistical_analysis.md** for complete implementations

### Phase 3: Regression Modeling

**When to use each model**:
- Polynomial (quadratic/cubic): Smooth dose-response, clear peak
- Natural spline: Flexible, non-parametric, handles complex patterns
- Linear: Simple relationships, checking for trends

Model comparison metrics:
- R-squared: Overall fit (higher = better)
- Adjusted R-squared: Penalizes complexity
- F-statistic p-value: Model significance
- AIC/BIC: Compare non-nested models

See: **references/statistical_analysis.md** for complete implementations

## Raw Image Processing Workflow

### When Processing Raw Images

**Workflow**: Load → Preprocess → Segment → Measure → Export

```python
# Quick start for cell counting
from scripts.segment_cells import count_cells_in_image

result = count_cells_in_image(
    image_path="cells.tif",
    channel=0,  # DAPI channel
    min_area=50
)
print(f"Found {result['count']} cells")
```

### Segmentation Method Selection

**Decision guide**:

| Cell Type | Density | Best Method | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Nuclei (DAPI)** | Low-Medium | Otsu + watershed | Standard approach |
| **Nuclei (DAPI)** | High | CellPose/StarDist | Handles touching |
| **Colonies** | Well-separated | Otsu threshold | Fast, reliable |
| **Colonies** | Touching | Watershed | Edge detection |
| **Cells (phase)** | Any | Adaptive threshold | Handles uneven illumination |
| **Fluorescence** | Low signal | Li threshold | More sensitive |

See: **references/segmentation.md** and **references/cell_counting.md** for detailed protocols

### Library Selection: scikit-image vs OpenCV

**Use scikit-image when**:
- Scientific measurements needed (area, perimeter, intensity)
- regionprops for object properties
- Publication-quality analysis
- Easier syntax for scientists

**Use OpenCV when**:
- Processing large image batches
- Speed is critical
- Real-time processing
- Advanced computer vision features

**Both work for**:
- Thresholding, filtering, morphological operations
- Basic image transformations
- Most segmentation tasks

See: **references/image_processing.md** "Library Selection Guide"

## Common BixBench Patterns

### Pattern 1: Colony Morphometry (bix-18)

**Question type**: "Mean circularity of genotype with largest area?"

**Data**: CSV with Genotype, Area, Circularity columns

**Workflow**:
1. Load CSV → group by Genotype
2. Calculate mean Area per genotype
3. Identify genotype with max mean Area
4. Report mean Circularity for that genotype

See: **references/segmentation.md** "Colony Morphometry Analysis"

### Pattern 2: Cell Counting Statistics (bix-19)

**Question type**: "Cohen's d for NeuN counts between conditions?"

**Data**: CSV with Condition, NeuN_count, Sex, Hemisphere columns

**Workflow**:
1. Load CSV → filter by hemisphere/sex if needed
2. Split by Condition (KD vs CTRL)
3. Calculate Cohen's d with pooled SD
4. Report effect size

See: **references/statistical_analysis.md** "Effect Size Calculations"

### Pattern 3: Multi-Group Comparison (bix-41)

**Question type**: "Dunnett's test: How many ratios equivalent to control?"

**Data**: CSV with multiple co-culture ratios, Area, Circularity

**Workflow**:
1. Create Strain_Ratio labels
2. Run Dunnett's test for Area (vs control)
3. Run Dunnett's test for Circularity (vs control)
4. Count groups NOT significant in BOTH tests

See: **references/statistical_analysis.md** "Dunnett's Test"

### Pattern 4: Regression Optimization (bix-54)

**Question type**: "Peak frequency from natural spline model?"

**Data**: CSV with co-culture frequencies and Area measurements

**Workflow**:
1. Convert ratio strings to frequencies
2. Fit natural spline model (df=4)
3. Find peak via grid search
4. Report peak frequency + confidence interval

See: **references/statistical_analysis.md** "Regression Modeling"

## Important Notes

### Matching R Statistical Functions

Some BixBench questions use R for analysis. Python equivalents:

- **R's Dunnett test** (`multcomp::glht`) → `scipy.stats.dunnett()` (scipy ≥ 1.10)
- **R's natural spline** (`ns(x, df=4)`) → `patsy.cr(x, knots=...)` with explicit quantile knots
- **R's t-test** (`t.test()`) → `scipy.stats.ttest_ind()`
- **R's ANOVA** (`aov()`) → `statsmodels.formula.api.ols()` + `sm.stats.anova_lm()`

See: **references/statistical_analysis.md** for exact parameter matching

### Answer Formatting

BixBench expects specific formats:
- "to the nearest thousand": `int(round(val, -3))`
- Percentages: Usually integer or 1-2 decimal places
- Cohen's d: 3 decimal places
- Sample sizes: Always integer (ceiling)
- Ratios: String format "5:1"

---

## Reasoning Framework for Result Interpretation

### Evidence Grading

| Grade | Criteria | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Strong** | p < 0.001, large effect size (Cohen's d > 0.8), N >= 30 per group | Dunnett's test p < 0.001 with d = 1.2 between treatment and control |
| **Moderate** | p < 0.05, medium effect (0.5 <= d < 0.8), adequate replication | ANOVA F-test p = 0.01 with partial eta-squared = 0.10 |
| **Weak** | p < 0.05 but small effect (0.2 <= d < 0.5) or low N | t-test p = 0.04 with d = 0.3, N = 8 per group |
| **Insufficient** | p >= 0.05 or N < 5 per group | Non-significant Dunnett's comparison with 3 replicates |

### Interpretation Guidance

- **Dunnett's test**: Controls family-wise error rate for many-vs-one comparisons. A non-significant result means the treatment group is statistically equivalent to control at the chosen alpha, not that there is no difference. Report adjusted p-values.
- **ANOVA p-values**: A significant omnibus F-test indicates at least one group differs; always follow up with post-hoc tests (Tukey, Dunnett's) to identify which groups. Report eta-squared for effect magnitude.
- **Cohen's d thresholds**: Small (0.2), medium (0.5), large (0.8). For morphometry, d > 0.5 typically indicates biologically meaningful size or shape differences. Always pair with raw mean differences and units.
- **Morphometry measurements**: Area is scale-dependent (report units: pixels or calibrated). Circularity near 1.0 = round colony (healthy growth); values < 0.5 suggest irregular morphology (swarming, stress). Roundness and circularity are distinct metrics and should not be interchanged.
- **Power analysis**: Post-hoc power < 0.80 for a detected effect suggests the study was underpowered; interpret non-significant results cautiously.

### Synthesis Questions

1. Do effect sizes (Cohen's d) align with the biological magnitude of the observed morphometric differences, or is statistical significance driven primarily by large sample size?
2. Are the assumptions underlying the statistical test met (normality via Shapiro-Wilk, homoscedasticity), and if violated, do non-parametric alternatives yield consistent conclusions?
3. For multi-group comparisons, do the Dunnett's-adjusted p-values change the interpretation relative to unadjusted pairwise tests, and are there groups near the significance boundary that warrant further investigation?
4. Does the regression model (polynomial vs. spline) provide a biologically plausible fit, or is overfitting inflating R-squared without meaningful predictive value?

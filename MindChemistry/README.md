## Introduction

Conventional chemistry studies have long been confronted with numerous challenges. The process of experimental design, synthesis, characterization, and analysis can be time-consuming, costly, and highly dependent on experts‚Äô experiences.
The synergy between AI and chemistry offers unprecedented opportunities to overcome the limitations of conventional approaches and unlock new frontiers in scientific discovery and innovation. AI techniques can efficiently process vast amount of data, mining underneath patterns and generating predictive models. By leveraging AI, chemistry and material science researchers can accelerate the design and optimization of chemical processes and the design and analysis of novel materials.

**MindSpore Chemistry**(MindChemistry) is a toolkit built on MindSpore endeavoring to integrate AI with conventional chemistry research. It supports multi-scale tasks including molecular generation, property prediction and synthesis optimization on multiple chemistry systems such as organic, inorganic and composites chemistry systems. MindChemistry dedicates to enabling the joint research of AI and chemistry with high efficiency, and seek to facilitate an innovative paradigm of joint research between AI and chemistry, providing experts with novel perspectives and efficient tools.

## Latest News

- üî•`2024.04.30` MindChemistry 0.1.0 is released.

## Features

### Applications

- Material Generation
    - **Scenario**ÔºöInorganic chemistry
    - **Dataset**ÔºöHigh-entropy alloy dataset. The high-entropy alloy dataset includes the chemical composition of known high-entropy alloys and thermodynamic properties of the alloys. It provides chemical composition information such as the metal element types and corresponding percentages as well as thermodynamic properties such as magnetostrictive effects and Curie temperatures.
    - **Task**ÔºöHigh-entropy alloy composition design. We integrate Machine learning-enabled high-entropy alloy discovery[1] approach for designing novel high-entropy alloys with low thermal expansion coefficients(TEC) in active learning fashion. In the active learning circle, candidates of high-enropy alloys are firstly generated based on the AI model and the candidate components are filtered based on the prediction model and the predicted thermal expansion coefficient calculated by the thermodynamics. Finally, the researchers need to determine the final high-entropy alloy components based on experimental verification.

- **Property Prediction**Ôºö
    - **Scenario**ÔºöOrganic chemistry
    - **Dataset**: Revised Molecular Dynamics 17(rMD17). rMD17 dataset includes molecular dynamics simulations of multiple organic chemical moleculars. It provides chemical desciptive information such as the atomic numbers and positions as well as molecular property information such as energies and forces.
    - **Task**ÔºöMolecular energy prediction. We integrate the NequIP model [2] and Allegro model [3], according to the position of each atom in the molecular system and structure description of the atomic number information construction diagram, and calculate the energy of the molecular system based on the equivariant calculation and graph neural network.

    - **Scenario**: Materials
    - **Dataset**: Bilayer graphene dataset. The dataset contains descriptive information such as atomic positions and atomic numbers, as well as property information such as Hamiltonian.
    - **Task**: Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction. We integrate the DeephE3nn model, an equivariant neural network based on E3, to predict a Hamiltonian by using the structure of atoms.

- **Prediction of crystalline material properties**:
    - **Scenario**: Materials
    - **Dataset**: JARVIS-DFT 3D dataset. The dataset contains descriptive information such as atomic position and atomic number of crystal materials, as well as property information such as energy and force field.
    - **Task**: Prediction of crystalline material properties. We integrate the Matformer model based on graph neural networks and Transformer architectures, for predicting various properties of crystalline materials.

### Modules

- **Equivariant Computing**
    - **Introduction**ÔºöSymmetry is an essential property in science domain. Equivarient neural network adopts intuitive representation as input and computing equivariently with respect to spatial rotation,shift and inversion. Adopting equivariant neural network for modeling scientific scenarios results in higher representation effectiveness for data and high efficiency for model training.
    - **Functions**ÔºöE(3) computing modules integrates basic modules such as Irreps, Spherical Harmonics and Tensor Products. Based on the basic modules, equivariant neural network layers such as equivariant Activation, Linear and Convolution layers are provided for constructing user customed equivariant neural networks.

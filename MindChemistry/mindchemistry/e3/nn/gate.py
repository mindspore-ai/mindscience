class Gate(nn.Cell):

    Gate activation function. The input contain three parts: the first part `irreps_scalars` are scalars that only be affected by activation functions `acts`;
    the second part `irreps_gates` are scalars that be affected by activation functions `act_gates` and be multiplied on the third part.

    .. math::
        \left(\bigoplus_i \phi_i(x_i) \right) \oplus \left(\bigoplus_j \phi_j(g_j) y_j \right)

    where :math:`x_i` and :math:`\phi_i` are from `irreps_scalars` and `acts`, and :math:`g_j`, :math:`\phi_j`, and :math:`y_j` are from `irreps_gates`, `act_gates`, and `irreps_gated`.

    Args:
        irreps_scalars (Union[str, Irrep, Irreps]): the input scalar irreps that will be passed through the activation functions `acts`.
        acts (List[Func]): a list of activation functions for each part of `irreps_scalars`. 
            The length of the `acts` will be clipped or filled by identity functions to match the length of `irreps_scalars`.
        irreps_gates (Union[str, Irrep, Irreps]): the input scalar irreps that will be passed through the activation functions `act_gates` and multiplied by `irreps_gated`.
        act_gates (List[Func]): a list of activation functions for each part of `irreps_gates`. 
            The length of the `acts` will be clipped or filled by identity functions to match the length of `irreps_gates`.
        irreps_gated (Union[str, Irrep, Irreps]): the input irreps that will be gated.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `irreps_scalars` or `irreps_gates` contain non-scalar irrep.
        ValueError: If the total multiplication of `irreps_gates` do not match the total multiplication of `irreps_gated`.

        ``CPU``, ``GPU``, ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> Gate('2x0e', [ops.tanh], '1x0o+2x0e', [ops.abs], '2x1o+1x2e')
        Gate (2x0e+1x0o+2x0e+2x1o+1x2e -> 2x0e+2x1o+1x2e)

class Norm(nn.Cell):
    r"""
    Norm of each irrep in a direct sum of irreps.

    Args:
        irreps_in (Union[str, Irrep, Irreps]): Irreps for the input.
        squared (bool): whether to return the squared norm. Default: False.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``CPU``, ``GPU``, ``Ascend``

    Examples:
        >>> n = Norm('3x1o')
        >>> v = ms.Tensor(np.linspace(1., 2., n.irreps_in.dim), dtype=ms.float32)
        >>> n(v).shape

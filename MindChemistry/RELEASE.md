# **MindChemistry 0.1.0 Release Notes**

MindSpore Chemistry is a toolkit built on MindSpore endeavoring to enable the joint research of AI and chemistry with high efficiency and to seek th facilitate an innovative paradigm of joint research between AI and chemistry.

## **Major Features**

* Provide a **high-entropy alloy composition design approach**: Based on generation model and ranking model generating high-entropy alloy composition candidates and candidates' ranks, this approach constructs an active learning workflow for enabling chemistry experts to accelerate design of novel materials.
* Provide a **molecular energy prediction model**: Based on equivariant computing library, the property prediction model is trained effectively and infers molecular energy with high accuracy given atomic information. 
* Provide an **equivariant computing library**: We provide basic modules such as Irreps, Spherical Harmonics as well as user-friendly equivariant layers such as equivarant Activation and Linear layers for easy construction of equivariant neural networks.

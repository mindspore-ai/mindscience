## MindSpore SPONGE 1.0.0-rc1 Release Notes

MindSpore SPONGE(Simulation Package tOwards Next GEneration molecular modelling) is a toolkit for Computational Biology based on AI framework MindSpore，which supports MD, folding and so on. It aims to provide efficient AI computational biology software for a wide range of scientific researchers, staff, teachers and students.

### Major Features and Improvements

- [STABLE] Protein Structure Prediction Tool MEGA-Fold.
- [STABLE] MSA Generation Tool MEGA-EvoGen：Multiple Sequence Alignment Dataset for protein structure and function research.
- [STABLE] Protein Structure Assessment Tool MEGA-Assessment：This tool evaluates the prediction accuracy of each residue in the protein structure and the inter-residue distance error. It further optimizes the protein structure based on the evaluation results.
- [STABLE] MindSPONGE.PipeLine module: This module contains over than 10 models and a unified invocation interface. User can invocate the model needed to perform training task and prediction task.

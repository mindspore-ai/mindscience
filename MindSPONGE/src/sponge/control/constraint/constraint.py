class Constraint(Controller):
    r"""Base class for constraint module in MindSPONGE, which is a subclass of `Controller`.

        The `Constraint` module is used for bond constraint. It controls the atomic coordinates, the atomic velocities,
        the atomic forces and the virial of the system during the simulation process.

    Args:

        system (Molecule):          Simulation system.

        bonds (Union[Tensor, str]): Bonds to be constraint.
                                    Tensor of shape (K, 2). Data type is int.
                                    Alternative: "h-bonds" or "all-bonds".

        potential (PotentialCell):  Potential Cell. Default: ``None``.

    Supported Platforms:

        ``Ascend`` ``GPU``

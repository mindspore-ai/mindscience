class Constraint(Controller):
    r"""
    Base class for constraint module in MindSPONGE, which is a subclass of
    :class:`sponge.control.Controller`.

    The :class:`sponge.control.Constraint` module is used for bond constraint.
    It controls the atomic coordinates, the atomic velocities,
    the atomic forces and the virial of the system during the simulation process.

    Args:
        system (:class:`sponge.system.Molecule`): Simulation system.

    Inputs:
        - **coordinate** (Tensor) - Coordinate. Tensor of shape :math:`(B, A, D)`.
          Data type is float.
          Here :math:`B` is the number of walkers in simulation,
          :math:`A` is the number of atoms and
          :math:`D` is the spatial dimension of the simulation system, which is usually 3.
        - **velocity** (Tensor) - Velocity. Tensor of shape :math:`(B, A, D)`. Data type is float.
        - **force** (Tensor) - Force. Tensor of shape :math:`(B, A, D)`. Data type is float.
        - **energy** (Tensor) - Energy. Tensor of shape :math:`(B, 1)`. Data type is float.
        - **kinetics** (Tensor) - Kinetics. Tensor of shape :math:`(B, D)`. Data type is float.
        - **virial** (Tensor) - Virial. Tensor of shape :math:`(B, D)`. Data type is float.
        - **pbc_box** (Tensor) - Pressure boundary condition box. Tensor of shape :math:`(B, D)`.
          Data type is float.
        - **step** (int) - Simulation step. Default: ``0``.

    Outputs:
        - coordinate, Tensor of shape :math:`(B, A, D)`. Coordinate. Data type is float.
        - velocity, Tensor of shape :math:`(B, A, D)`. Velocity. Data type is float.
        - force, Tensor of shape :math:`(B, A, D)`. Force. Data type is float.
        - energy, Tensor of shape :math:`(B, 1)`. Energy. Data type is float.
        - kinetics, Tensor of shape :math:`(B, D)`. Kinetics. Data type is float.
        - virial, Tensor of shape :math:`(B, D)`. Virial. Data type is float.
        - pbc_box, Tensor of shape :math:`(B, D)`. Periodic boundary condition box.
          Data type is float.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU``

    Examples:
        >>> from sponge import Molecule
        >>> from sponge.control import Constraint
        >>> system = Molecule(template='water.tip3p.yaml')
        >>> controller = Constraint(system)

        mass (Union[Tensor, ndarray, list]):
                            Array of the mass of the atoms to calculate the center of mass (COM).
                            The shape of Tensor is (..., G) or (B, ..., G), and the data type is float.
                            If it is None, the geometric center of coordinate will be calculated.
                            Default: None

        batched (bool):     Whether the first dimension of index and mass is the batch size.
                            Default: False

        keep_in_box (bool): Whether to displace the coordinate in PBC box.
                            Default: False

        keepdims (bool):    If this is set to True, the axis which is reduced will be left,
                            and the shape the center will be (..., 1, D).
                            If this is set to False, the shape of the center will be (..., D).
                            if None, its value will be determined according to the rank (number of dimension) of
                            the input atoms: False if the rank is greater than 2, otherwise True.
                            Default: None

        axis (int):         Axis along which the average of position are coumputed. Default: -2

        name (str):         Name of the Colvar. Default: 'atoms_center'

    Supported Platforms:

        ``Ascend`` ``GPU``

    Symbols:

        B:  Batchsize, i.e. number of walkers in simulation

        A:  Number of atoms in system.

        G:  Number of the group of atoms to be averaged.

        D:  Spatial dimension of the simulation system. Usually is 3.

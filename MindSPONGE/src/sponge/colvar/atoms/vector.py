class Vector(AtomsBase):
    r"""Vector between specific atoms or virtual atoms

    Args:

        atoms (AtomsBase):  Atoms of shape `(..., 2, D)` to form a vector of shape `(..., D)` or `(..., 1, D)`.
                            Cannot be used with `atoms0` or `atoms1`.
                            Default: None

        atoms0 (AtomsBase): The initial point of atoms of shape `(..., D)` to form a vector of shape `(..., D)`.
                            Must be used with `atoms1`, and cannot be used with `atoms`.
                            Default: None

        atoms1 (AtomsBase): The terminal point of atoms of shape `(..., D)` to form a vector of shape `(..., D)`.
                            Must be used with `atoms0`, and cannot be used with `atoms`.
                            Default: None

        batched (bool):     Whether the first dimension of index is the batch size.
                            Default: False

        use_pbc (bool):     Whether to calculate distance under periodic boundary condition.
                            Default: None

        keepdims (bool):    If this is set to True, the axis which is take from the `atoms` will be left,
                            and the shape of the vector will be `(..., 1, D)`
                            If this is set to False, the shape of the vector will be `(..., D)`
                            if None, its value will be determined according to the rank (number of dimension) of
                            the input atoms: False if the rank is greater than 2, otherwise True.
                            It only works when initialized with `atoms`.
                            Default: None

        axis (int):         Axis along which the coordinate of atoms are take, of which the dimension must be 2.
                            It only works when initialized with `atoms`.
                            Default: -2

        name (str):         Name of the Colvar. Default: 'vector'

    Supported Platforms:

        ``Ascend`` ``GPU``

    Symbols:

        B:  Batchsize, i.e. number of walkers in simulation

        A:  Number of atoms in system.

        D:  Spatial dimension of the simulation system. Usually is 3.

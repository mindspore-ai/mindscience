        Uses hmmalign to align the sequences to the profile, then outputs the
        sequence concatenated at the beginning of the sequences in the A3M format.
        As the sequences are represented by an alignment with possible gaps ('-')
        and insertions (lowercase characters), the method first removes the gaps,
        then uppercases the insertions to prepare the sequences for realignment.
        Sequences with gaps cannot be aligned, as '-'s are not a valid symbol to
        align; lowercase characters must be uppercased to preserve the original
        sequences before realignment.

"""Functions for producing "paired" and "unpaired" MSA features for each chain.

The paired MSA:
- Is made from the result of the all_seqs MSA query.
- Is ordered such that you can concatenate features across chains and related
    sequences will end up on the same row. Related here means "from the same
    species". Gaps are added to facilitate this whenever a sequence has no
    suitable pair.

The unpaired MSA:
- Is made from the results of the remaining MSA queries.
- Has no special ordering properties.
- Is deduplicated such that it doesn't contain any sequences in the paired MSA.

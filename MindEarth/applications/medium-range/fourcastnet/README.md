# FourCastNet

## Overview

FourCastNet is a data-driven global weather forecast model. It provides medium-term forecasts of key global weather indicators with a resolution of 0.25°，Equivalent to a spatial resolution of approximately 30 km x 30 km near the equator and a global grid of 721 x 1440 pixels in size.

In order to achieve high resolution prediction, FourCastNet uses AFNO model. The model network architecture is designed for high-resolution input, uses ViT as the backbone network, and incorporates Fourier Neural Operator.

## QuickStart

You can download dataset from fourcastnet/dataset for model evaluation. Save these dataset at `./dataset`.

### Run Option 1: Call `main.py` from command line

```shell
python -u ./main.py \
  --device_target Ascend \
  --device_id 0 \
  --grid_resolution 1.4 \
  --output_dir ./summary \
```

where:
--device_target decice type, default Ascend.
--device_id NPU id, default 0。
--grid_resolution grid resolution, default 1.4.
--output_dir the path of output file, default "./summary".

### Run Option 2: Run Jupyter Notebook

You can use 'Chinese' or 'English' Jupyter Notebook to run the training and evaluation code line-by-line.

### Analysis

The following figure shows the ground truth, predicion and their errors using the checkpoint of training epoch 10.

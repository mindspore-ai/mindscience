# ViT-KNO

## Overview

ViT-KNO is a deep learning model that leverages the Vision Transformer structure and Koopman theory to efficiently learn Koopman operators for predicting dynamics in nonlinear systems. By embedding the complicated dynamics in a linear structure through a constraint reconstruction process, ViT-KNO is able to capture complex nonlinear behaviors while remaining lightweight and computationally efficient. The model has clear mathematical theory and has the potential to enable breakthroughs in fields such as meteorology, fluid dynamics, and computational physics.

## QuickStart

You can download dataset from koopman_vit/dataset for model evaluation. Save these dataset at `./dataset`.

### Run Option 1: Call `main.py` from command line

```shell
python -u ./main.py \
  --device_target Ascend \
  --device_id 0 \
  --grid_resolution 1.4 \
  --output_dir ./summary \
```

where:
--device_target decice type, default Ascend.
--device_id NPU id, default 0ã€‚
--grid_resolution grid resolution, default 1.4.
--output_dir the path of output file, default "./summary".

### Run Option 2: Run Jupyter Notebook

You can use 'Chinese' or 'English' Jupyter Notebook to run the training and evaluation code line-by-line.

### Analysis

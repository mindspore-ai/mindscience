# [PINNs Description](#contents)

PINNs (Physics Information Neural Networks) is a neural network proposed in 2019. PINNs network provides a new approach for solving partial differential equations with neural network. Partial differential equations are often used in the modeling of physical, biological and engineering systems. The characteristics of such systems have significantly difference from most problems in machine learning: (1) the cost of data acquisition is high, and the amount of data is usually small;(2) a large amount of priori knowledge, such as previous research result like physical laws, are hard to be utilized by machine learning systems.

In PINNs, firstly the prior knowledge in the form of partial differential equation is introduced as the regularization term of the network through proper construction of the Pinns network. Then, by utilizing the prior knowledge in PINNs, the network can train very good results with very little data. The effectiveness of PINNs are verified in various scenarios such as quantum mechanics and hydrodynamics.

# [Model Architecture](#contents)

Pinns is a new framework of constructing neural network for solving partial differential equations. The specific model structure will change according to the partial differential equations. The network structure of each application scenario of PINNs implemented in MindSpore is as follows:

## [Schrodinger equation](#Contents)

The Schrodinger equation is the basic equation in quantum mechanics, which describes the wave function of particles. The PINNs of the Schrodinger equation can be divided into two parts. First, a neural network composed of five fully connected layers is used to fit the wave function to be solved (i.e., the solution of the Schrodinger equation in the quantum mechanics system described by the data set). The neural network has two outputs, which represent the real part and the imaginary part of the wave function respectively. Then, the two outputs are followed by some derivative operations. The Schrodinger equation can be expressed by properly combining these derivative results, and act as a constraint term of the neural network.  The outputs of the whole network are the real part, imaginary part and some related partial derivatives of the wave function.

## [Navier-Stokes equation](#Contents)

The Navier-Stokes equation is the equation describing incompressible Newtonian fluid in hydrodynamics. The PINNs of the Navier-Stokes equation can be divided into two parts. First, a neural network composed of nine fully connected layers is used to fit a latent function and the pressure. The derivatives of the latent function are related to the velocity field. Then, the two outputs are followed by some derivative operations. The Navier-Stokes equation can be expressed by properly combining these derivative results, and act as a constraint term of the neural network.

# [Features](#contents)

## [Mixed Precision](#Contents)

The [mixed precision](https://mindspore.cn/tutorials/en/master/advanced/mixed_precision.html) training method accelerates the deep learning neural network training process by using both the single-precision and half-precision data formats, and maintains the network precision achieved by the single-precision training at the same time. Mixed precision training can accelerate the computation process, reduce memory usage, and enable a larger model or batch size to be trained on specific hardware.
For FP16 operators, if the input data type is FP32, the backend of MindSpore will automatically handle it with reduced precision. Users could check the reduced-precision operators by enabling INFO log and then searching ‘reduce precision’.

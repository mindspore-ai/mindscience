    For example, for the given input:
      query_sequence : ABCDEFGHIJKL
      hit_sequence   : ---DEFGHIJK-
      struc_sequence : XDEFGHKL
    the mapping is {3: 0, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 3, 7: 4, 8: 5, 9: 6, 10: 7}. However, the
    actual Structure sequence has an extra X at the start as well as no IJ. So the
    alignment from the query to the Structure sequence will be:
      hit_sequence   : ---DEFGHIJK-
      struc_aligned  : --XDEFGH--KL
    and the new mapping will therefore be: {3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 4, 7: 5, 10: 6}.

    Args:
      hit_sequence: The PDB seqres hit sequence obtained from Hmmsearch, but
        without any gaps. This is not the full PDB seqres template sequence but
        rather just its subsequence from hit_start_index to hit_end_index.
      hit_start_index: The start index of the hit sequence in the full PDB seqres
        template sequence (inclusive).
      hit_end_index: The end index of the hit sequence in the full PDB seqres
        template sequence (exclusive).
      full_length: The length of the full PDB seqres template sequence.
      structure_sequence: The actual sequence extracted from the Structure
        corresponding to this template. In vast majority of cases this is the same
        as the PDB seqres sequence, but this function handles the cases when not.
      query_to_hit_mapping: The mapping from the query sequence to the
        hit_sequence.

    Raises:
      AlignmentError: if the alignment between the sequence returned by Hmmsearch
        differs from the actual sequence found in the mmCIF and can't be aligned
        using the simple alignment algorithm.

    Returns:
      A mapping from the query sequence to the actual Structure sequence.

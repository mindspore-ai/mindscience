# Aging & Cellular Senescence Research

Pipeline for investigating aging biology through genetics, gene expression, pathways, drug discovery, and literature integration. Covers the molecular hallmarks of aging and translates them into research actionables.

**Key principles**:
1. **Hallmarks framework** — organize findings around the 12 hallmarks of aging (Lopez-Otin 2023)
2. **Senescence is not just aging** — cellular senescence is one mechanism; distinguish from organismal aging, progeria, and age-related disease
3. **SASP matters** — the senescence-associated secretory phenotype drives much of senescence pathology; always check SASP factors
4. **Evidence grading** — T1: human genetic evidence (GWAS, centenarian studies), T2: model organism lifespan data, T3: cell culture senescence data, T4: computational prediction
5. **Translational focus** — connect biology to senolytic drugs, geroprotectors, and clinical trials

## When to Use

- "What genes are associated with longevity?"
- "Find senolytic drug candidates for [disease]"
- "What are the markers of cellular senescence?"
- "How does [gene] relate to aging?"
- "GWAS hits for age-related diseases"
- "Pathways involved in cellular senescence"
- "What drugs target senescent cells?"

**Not this skill**: For rare disease genetics, use `tooluniverse-rare-disease-diagnosis`. For general disease research, use `tooluniverse-disease-research`.

### Phase 1: Hallmarks of Aging Classification

The 12 hallmarks of aging (Lopez-Otin et al., Cell 2023) provide the organizing framework:

| Hallmark | Key Genes/Pathways | ToolUniverse Query Strategy |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Genomic instability** | ATM, ATR, BRCA1/2, TP53 | `STRING_get_network`, DNA repair pathways |
| **Telomere attrition** | TERT, TERC, POT1, TRF1/2 | `kegg_search_pathway(keyword="telomere")` |
| **Epigenetic alterations** | DNMT1/3, TET1-3, HDAC, SIRT1-7 | ENCODE, epigenomics tools |
| **Loss of proteostasis** | HSP70/90, UPS, autophagy | `kegg_search_pathway(keyword="autophagy")` → hsa04140 |
| **Disabled macroautophagy** | ATG5, BECN1, LC3, mTOR | KEGG autophagy pathway (hsa04140) |
| **Deregulated nutrient sensing** | mTOR, AMPK, IGF1, FOXO, SIRT1 | `KEGG_get_pathway_genes(pathway_id="hsa04150")` (mTOR) |
| **Mitochondrial dysfunction** | PINK1, PARKIN, PGC1α, TFAM | `kegg_search_pathway(keyword="mitophagy")` |
| **Cellular senescence** | p16/CDKN2A, p21/CDKN1A, p53, RB | **KEGG hsa04218** (cellular senescence) |
| **Stem cell exhaustion** | WNT, NOTCH, BMI1, NANOG | Stem cell signaling pathways |
| **Altered intercellular communication** | NF-κB, SASP factors (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) | `STRING_get_network` with SASP genes |
| **Chronic inflammation** | TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, NLRP3 | Inflammaging gene sets |
| **Dysbiosis** | Gut microbiome changes | `tooluniverse-metagenomics-analysis` skill |

**How to use this**: When a user asks about an aging gene, first classify which hallmark(s) it belongs to, then investigate that hallmark's pathway and disease connections.

### Phase 2: Genetic Evidence

**Longevity GWAS loci** (well-established):

| Locus | Gene | Effect | Evidence |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| 9p21.3 | CDKN2A/B (p16/p15) | Senescence regulator | T1: GWAS for CVD, cancer, T2D — all age-related |
| 19q13.32 | APOE (ε2/ε3/ε4) | Lipid metabolism, neurodegeneration | T1: strongest longevity GWAS signal |
| 5q33.3 | FOXO3 | Stress resistance, autophagy | T1: replicated in multiple centenarian studies |
| 6q21 | FOXO3 (enhancer) | Same gene, different signal | T1: fine-mapped to regulatory variant |
| 10q24 | TERT | Telomere maintenance | T1: GWAS for telomere length |

```python
# Strategy 1 (BEST for gene-centric): Get all GWAS SNPs for the gene
gwas_get_snps_for_gene(gene_symbol="FOXO3")  # Returns all associated SNPs at the locus

# Strategy 2: Search by trait (returns studies, not gene-specific)
gwas_search_associations(query="telomere length")  # Works for broad trait queries
# WARNING: gwas_search_associations(query="longevity") may return 0 results —
# "longevity" is not a standard EFO trait term. Try "lifespan" or specific diseases.

# Strategy 3: OpenTargets aggregated genetic evidence
OpenTargets_get_associated_targets_by_disease_efoId(efoId="EFO_0004847", limit=20)  # aging

# Strategy 4: Literature (essential for centenarian studies not in GWAS Catalog)
PubMed_search_articles(query="FOXO3 GWAS longevity centenarian meta-analysis")
# Many FOXO3 longevity studies (Willcox 2008, Flachsbart 2009) are in PubMed
# but NOT in GWAS Catalog because they used targeted genotyping, not GWAS arrays.
```

### Phase 3: Pathway Analysis

**Key senescence pathways**:

```python
# The master senescence pathway
KEGG_get_pathway_genes(pathway_id="hsa04218")  # Cellular senescence
# Returns: CDKN2A, CDKN1A, TP53, RB1, CDK4/6, E2F, TERT, ATM/ATR, etc.

# Supporting pathways
kegg_search_pathway(keyword="autophagy")       # hsa04140 — Autophagy
kegg_search_pathway(keyword="mTOR signaling")  # hsa04150 — mTOR
kegg_search_pathway(keyword="FOXO signaling")  # hsa04068 — FOXO
kegg_search_pathway(keyword="p53 signaling")   # hsa04115 — p53

# SASP network (senescence-associated secretory phenotype)
sasp_genes = ["IL6", "IL8", "MCP1", "MMP3", "MMP9", "PAI1", "IGFBP7", "VEGF", "CCL2"]
STRING_get_network(identifiers="\r".join(sasp_genes), species=9606)
ReactomeAnalysis_pathway_enrichment(identifiers=" ".join(sasp_genes))
```

**Senescence marker interpretation**:

| Marker | What It Means | Caveats |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| p16 (CDKN2A) ↑ | Irreversible cell cycle arrest; gold standard senescence marker | Also elevated in some cancers (paradox) |
| p21 (CDKN1A) ↑ | Cell cycle arrest; can be transient (quiescence) or permanent (senescence) | Not specific to senescence — also DNA damage response |
| SA-β-gal ↑ | Lysosomal activity increase in senescent cells | Assay artifact in high-confluence cultures |
| SASP (IL-6, IL-8) ↑ | Paracrine signaling from senescent cells | Also elevated in infection, autoimmunity |
| γH2AX foci ↑ | DNA double-strand breaks, telomere dysfunction | Transient in DNA damage; persistent = senescence |
| Lamin B1 ↓ | Nuclear envelope disruption | Also disrupted in laminopathies |
| Telomere shortening | Replicative senescence | Only relevant for replicative, not oncogene-induced senescence |

### Phase 4: Senolytic & Geroprotector Drug Discovery

**Known senolytics** (drugs that selectively kill senescent cells):

| Drug | Target | Evidence | Clinical Status |
|------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Dasatinib + Quercetin (D+Q) | Src/BCR-ABL + PI3K/AKT | T1: Phase II trials (IPF, diabetic kidney disease) | Most advanced senolytic combo |
| Navitoclax (ABT-263) | BCL-2/BCL-XL | T2: preclinical in mouse models | Thrombocytopenia limits clinical use |
| Fisetin | PI3K/AKT/mTOR | T1: Phase II (frailty, COVID) | Natural flavonoid; bioavailability concerns |
| FOXO4-DRI peptide | p53-FOXO4 interaction | T2: mouse (restored fitness in aged mice) | Preclinical |
| UBX0101 | MDM2/p53 | T1: Phase II for osteoarthritis (FAILED) | Discontinued |
| Cardiac glycosides | Na+/K+-ATPase | T3: in vitro senolytic activity | Narrow therapeutic window |

```python
# Find senolytic drug interactions
DGIdb_get_drug_gene_interactions(genes=["BCL2", "BCL2L1", "TP53", "CDKN2A"])
search_clinical_trials(condition="senescence", query_term="senolytic")
search_clinical_trials(condition="aging", query_term="dasatinib quercetin")
ChEMBL_search_drugs(query="navitoclax")
```

**Geroprotectors** (drugs that slow aging):

| Drug | Mechanism | Evidence |
|------|----------|---------|
| Rapamycin/everolimus | mTOR inhibition | T1: FDA-approved (transplant); T2: lifespan extension in mice |
| Metformin | AMPK activation | T1: TAME trial (ongoing); T2: observational data |
| NAD+ precursors (NMN, NR) | NAD+ restoration, sirtuin activation | T1: Phase II trials; T3: mouse lifespan data |
| Spermidine | Autophagy induction | T2: mouse lifespan; T1: observational (dietary) |

### Phase 5: Literature & Clinical Context

```python
PubMed_search_articles(query="cellular senescence senolytics clinical trial", max_results=20)
search_clinical_trials(condition="cellular senescence")
search_clinical_trials(query_term="rapamycin aging")
```

### Phase 6: Report Structure

1. **Hallmarks Classification** — which of the 12 hallmarks are relevant
2. **Genetic Evidence** — GWAS loci, longevity genes, model organism data
3. **Pathway Analysis** — senescence, autophagy, mTOR, FOXO pathways with gene lists
4. **Senescence Markers** — expression evidence with interpretation caveats
5. **Drug Candidates** — senolytics and geroprotectors with evidence grades and clinical status
6. **Clinical Trials** — ongoing trials for senolytic/geroprotective interventions
7. **Mechanistic Model** — how the investigated gene/pathway contributes to aging
8. **Research Gaps** — what's missing and what experiments would fill the gaps

## Computational Procedure: Age-Dependent Expression Analysis

When investigating whether a gene's expression changes with age:

```python
# Use GTEx age data to assess age-dependent expression
# GTEx provides expression by age group (20-29, 30-39, ..., 60-69, 70-79)
# This requires GTEx bulk downloads for full age analysis
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import spearmanr

# Example: check if CDKN2A expression increases with age across tissues
# GTEx median expression API gives tissue-level data but not age-stratified
# For age analysis, search PubMed for published GTEx age studies:
# PubMed_search_articles(query="GTEx age-dependent expression CDKN2A")

# Alternative: use GEO datasets with age metadata
# GEO_search_rnaseq_datasets(query="aging human blood transcriptome")
# Then download and analyze the count matrix with age as a covariate
```

---

## Limitations

- **Aging is multifactorial** — no single gene or pathway explains aging; this skill helps investigate specific aspects
- **Model organism translation** — mouse lifespan studies don't always translate to humans (different telomere biology, metabolic rate)
- **Senescence markers are imperfect** — no single marker defines senescence; use a panel (p16 + SA-β-gal + SASP + γH2AX)
- **Clinical senolytics are early-stage** — most trials are Phase I/II; no FDA-approved senolytic yet
- **Epigenetic clocks** — not directly queryable via ToolUniverse tools (Horvath/Hannum clocks require methylation array data processing)

# Proteomics Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data from protein identification through quantification, differential expression, post-translational modifications, and systems-level interpretation.

## When to Use This Skill

**Triggers**: User has proteomics MS output files, asks about protein abundance/expression, differential protein expression, PTM analysis, protein-RNA correlation, multi-omics integration involving proteomics, protein complex/interaction analysis, or proteomics biomarker discovery.

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data Import** | MaxQuant, Spectronaut, DIA-NN, Proteome Discoverer, FragPipe outputs |
| **Quality Control** | Missing value analysis, intensity distributions, sample clustering |
| **Normalization** | Median, quantile, TMM, VSN normalization methods |
| **Imputation** | MinProb, KNN, QRILC for missing values |
| **Differential Expression** | Limma, DEP, MSstats for statistical testing |
| **PTM Analysis** | Phospho-site localization, PTM enrichment, kinase prediction |
| **Protein-RNA Integration** | Correlation analysis, translation efficiency |
| **Pathway Enrichment** | Over-representation and GSEA for protein sets |
| **PPI Analysis** | Protein complex detection, interaction networks via STRING/IntAct |
| **Reporting** | Comprehensive reports with volcano plots, heatmaps, pathway diagrams |

## Workflow Overview

```
Input: MS Proteomics Data
    |
Phase 1: Data Import & QC
Phase 2: Preprocessing (filter, impute, normalize)
Phase 3: Differential Expression Analysis
Phase 4: PTM Analysis (if applicable)
Phase 5: Functional Enrichment (GO, KEGG, Reactome)
Phase 6: Protein-Protein Interactions (STRING networks)
Phase 7: Multi-Omics Integration (optional, protein-RNA correlation)
Phase 8: Generate Report
```

## Interpretation Framework

### Differential Expression Interpretation

| Metric | Strong | Moderate | Weak |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| **padj** | < 0.01 | 0.01-0.05 | 0.05-0.1 |
| **Fold change** | > 2.0 | 1.5-2.0 | 1.2-1.5 |
| **Unique peptides** | > 5 | 2-5 | 1-2 (unreliable) |
| **Missing rate** | < 20% | 20-50% | > 50% (imputation needed) |

### Evidence Grading

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|---------|
| **T1** | Validated by orthogonal method (Western blot, PRM) + functional study |
| **T2** | Significant DE (padj < 0.05, FC > 1.5) in 2+ biological replicates |
| **T3** | Significant DE in 1 experiment, or significant but low FC |
| **T4** | Identified but not quantified, or single peptide identification |

### Synthesis Questions

1. **How many proteins are differentially expressed?** (>500 DE proteins suggests global perturbation; <50 suggests targeted effect)
2. **Are key pathway proteins concordantly regulated?** (all subunits of a complex changing = high confidence)
3. **Do proteomics results correlate with transcriptomics?** (low correlation is common — post-translational regulation)
4. **Are PTM changes driving the phenotype?** (check phosphoproteomics if available)
5. **What is the coverage relative to the expected proteome?** (human: ~10K quantified is good; <3K is limited)

## Limitations

- **Platform-specific**: Optimized for MS-based proteomics (not Western blot quantification)
- **Missing values**: High missing rate (>50% per protein) limits statistical power
- **PTM analysis**: Requires enrichment protocols for comprehensive PTM profiling
- **Absolute quantification**: Relative abundance only (unless TMT/SILAC used)
- **Protein isoforms**: Typically collapsed to gene level
- **Dynamic range**: MS has limited dynamic range vs mRNA sequencing

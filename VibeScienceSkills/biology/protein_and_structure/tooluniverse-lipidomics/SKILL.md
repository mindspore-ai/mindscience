# Lipidomics Analysis

Integrated pipeline for lipid identification, classification, pathway mapping, and disease association analysis. Distinct from general metabolomics because lipids have unique classification systems (LIPID MAPS), specialized pathways (sphingolipid, eicosanoid, steroid), and disease associations (cardiovascular, neurodegeneration, metabolic syndrome).

**Key principles**:
1. **LIPID MAPS classification first** — use the 8-category system (fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterol lipids, prenol lipids, saccharolipids, polyketides)
2. **Structural specificity matters** — chain length, unsaturation, and sn-position affect biological function
3. **Connect to pathways** — lipids are metabolic intermediates; always map to biosynthesis/degradation pathways
4. **Disease context** — many lipids are disease biomarkers (sphingolipids in neurodegeneration, oxidized lipids in CVD)
5. **Evidence grading** — T1: clinical biomarker studies, T2: mechanistic studies, T3: association data, T4: computational prediction

## When to Use

- "Identify this lipid species from m/z and retention time"
- "What pathways involve ceramide/sphingomyelin?"
- "Lipid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease"
- "What diseases are associated with altered sphingolipid metabolism?"
- "Map my lipidomics results to KEGG pathways"
- "Compare lipid profiles between conditions"

**Not this skill**: For general metabolomics (amino acids, sugars, organic acids), use `tooluniverse-metabolomics`. For drug ADMET properties, use `tooluniverse-admet-prediction`.

---

## Workflow

```
Phase 0: Lipid Identity Resolution
  Name/mass/abbreviation → LIPID MAPS ID → classification
    |
Phase 1: Structural Classification
  LIPID MAPS 8-category system → subclass → molecular species
    |
Phase 2: Pathway Mapping
  KEGG lipid metabolism → biosynthesis/degradation enzymes
    |
Phase 3: Disease Associations
  CTD/DisGeNET/HMDB → lipid-disease links with evidence
    |
Phase 4: Interpretation & Report
  Biological significance → biomarker potential → recommendations
```

### Phase 0: Lipid Identity Resolution

```
LipidMaps_search_by_name(query="ceramide")  → LMSP ID, exact mass, classification
HMDB_search(compound_name="ceramide")       → HMDB ID, disease links
PubChem_get_CID_by_compound_name(name="ceramide") → CID, SMILES
```

**LIPID MAPS search tips**:
- Generic names work well: "ceramide", "sphingomyelin", "phosphatidylcholine"
- Species-level abbreviations like "Cer(d18:1/16:0)" may return 0 results — use the generic class name first, then filter by chain length from results
- For exact mass search: use `LipidMaps_search_by_formula` with molecular formula (e.g., "C34H67NO3")
- If name search fails, try PubChem: `PubChem_get_CID_by_compound_name(name="C16 Ceramide")` then cross-reference

### Phase 1: Structural Classification

LIPID MAPS classifies all lipids into 8 categories:

| Category | Prefix | Examples | Biological Role |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Fatty Acyls | FA | Palmitic acid, arachidonic acid, DHA | Energy storage, signaling precursors |
| Glycerolipids | GL | Triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols | Energy storage (fat), signaling (DAG) |
| Glycerophospholipids | GP | Phosphatidylcholine, PE, PS, PI | Membrane structure, signaling |
| Sphingolipids | SP | Ceramide, sphingomyelin, gangliosides | Membrane rafts, apoptosis, neurodegeneration |
| Sterol Lipids | ST | Cholesterol, bile acids, vitamin D | Membrane fluidity, hormone precursors |
| Prenol Lipids | PR | Coenzyme Q, dolichol | Electron transport, protein modification |
| Saccharolipids | SL | Lipid A (LPS component) | Bacterial cell wall, innate immunity trigger |
| Polyketides | PK | Aflatoxins, erythromycin | Natural products, some drugs |

**Interpretation**: The LIPID MAPS category tells you the biological context immediately. Sphingolipid changes → think neurodegeneration, apoptosis, inflammation. Glycerophospholipid changes → think membrane remodeling. Eicosanoid changes (from arachidonic acid) → think inflammation.

### Phase 2: Pathway Mapping

Key lipid metabolism pathways in KEGG:

| Pathway | KEGG ID | Key Enzymes | Disease Relevance |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sphingolipid metabolism | hsa00600 | SMPD1, CERS1-6, ASAH1 | Niemann-Pick, Fabry, Gaucher |
| Glycerophospholipid metabolism | hsa00564 | PLA2, LPCAT, LPIN | Barth syndrome, atherosclerosis |
| Arachidonic acid metabolism | hsa00590 | COX1/2, LOX, CYP450 | Inflammation, asthma, CVD |
| Steroid biosynthesis | hsa00100 | HMGCR, CYP51A1, DHCR7 | Hypercholesterolemia, Smith-Lemli-Opitz |
| Fatty acid biosynthesis | hsa00061 | FASN, ACC, SCD | Obesity, NAFLD, cancer |
| Fatty acid degradation | hsa00071 | CPT1, ACADM, HADHA | MCAD deficiency, VLCAD deficiency |
| Bile acid biosynthesis | hsa00120 | CYP7A1, CYP27A1 | Cholestasis, gallstones |
| Ether lipid metabolism | hsa00565 | AGPS, GNPAT | Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia |

```python
# Map lipids to pathways
kegg_search_pathway(keyword="sphingolipid")  # → hsa00600
KEGG_get_pathway_genes(pathway_id="hsa00600")  # → SMPD1, CERS1, ...
```

### Phase 3: Disease Associations

For each lipid or lipid enzyme, check disease links:

```python
CTD_get_gene_diseases(input_terms="SMPD1")  # sphingomyelinase → Niemann-Pick
DisGeNET_search_gene(gene="SMPD1")  # broader disease associations
HMDB_get_metabolite(compound_name="ceramide")  # metabolite-disease links
PubMed_search_articles(query="ceramide biomarker Alzheimer")  # clinical evidence
```

**Disease interpretation framework for lipids**:

| Lipid Change | Direction | Common Disease Context | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ceramide ↑ | Elevated | Alzheimer's, heart failure, insulin resistance | Apoptosis induction, mitochondrial dysfunction |
| Sphingomyelin ↓ | Depleted | Niemann-Pick disease type A/B | SMPD1 deficiency → SM accumulation in lysosomes |
| Lysophosphatidylcholine ↑ | Elevated | Atherosclerosis, inflammation | Lp-PLA2 activity, foam cell formation |
| Oxidized phospholipids ↑ | Elevated | CVD, atherosclerosis | LDL oxidation, endothelial dysfunction |
| Bile acids (altered ratio) | Shifted | NAFLD, cholestasis, IBD | FXR/TGR5 signaling disruption |
| Eicosanoids (PGE2, LTB4) ↑ | Elevated | Inflammation, cancer | COX-2/LOX overactivation |
| Gangliosides (altered) | Variable | Tay-Sachs, Gaucher, cancer | Glycosphingolipid degradation defects |

### Phase 4: Interpretation & Report

**Computational procedure: Lipid class enrichment analysis**

```python
# When user provides a list of significantly changed lipids
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import fisher_exact

# Input: list of changed lipids with LIPID MAPS categories
changed = pd.DataFrame({
    'lipid': ['Cer(d18:1/16:0)', 'SM(d18:1/16:0)', 'PC(16:0/18:1)', 'LPC(18:0)'],
    'category': ['SP', 'SP', 'GP', 'GP'],
    'direction': ['up', 'down', 'unchanged', 'up'],
    'fold_change': [2.1, 0.5, 1.1, 1.8]
})

# Count changed vs unchanged per category
from collections import Counter
changed_cats = Counter(changed[changed['direction'] != 'unchanged']['category'])
total_cats = Counter(changed['category'])

# Report
print("Lipid class enrichment:")
for cat in total_cats:
    n_changed = changed_cats.get(cat, 0)
    n_total = total_cats[cat]
    print(f"  {cat}: {n_changed}/{n_total} changed")

# Interpretation
if changed_cats.get('SP', 0) / max(total_cats.get('SP', 1), 1) > 0.5:
    print("→ Sphingolipid metabolism is significantly altered")
    print("  Consider: apoptosis, neurodegeneration, insulin resistance")
```

**Report structure**:
1. **Lipid Identity** — LIPID MAPS classification, structural features
2. **Pathway Context** — which metabolic pathways are affected
3. **Disease Associations** — evidence-graded disease links
4. **Biomarker Assessment** — clinical utility of identified lipid changes
5. **Mechanistic Model** — how lipid changes connect to disease biology
6. **Recommendations** — validation experiments, clinical follow-up

## Limitations

- **No raw MS data processing** — this skill interprets identified lipids, not raw spectra. Use LipidSearch, MS-DIAL, or LipiDex for identification first.
- **LIPID MAPS coverage** — some rare or novel lipid species may not be in the database
- **Quantitative thresholds** — fold-change cutoffs are context-dependent; the skill provides frameworks, not universal thresholds
- **Species-specific** — most disease data is human; rat/mouse lipid metabolism can differ significantly

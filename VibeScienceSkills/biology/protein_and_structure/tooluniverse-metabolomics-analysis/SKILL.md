# Metabolomics Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of metabolomics data from metabolite identification through quantification, statistical analysis, pathway interpretation, and integration with other omics layers.

## When to Use This Skill

**Triggers**:
- User has metabolomics data (LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR)
- Questions about metabolite abundance or concentrations
- Differential metabolite analysis requests
- Metabolic pathway analysis
- Multi-omics integration with metabolomics
- Metabolic biomarker discovery
- Flux balance analysis or metabolic modeling
- Metabolite-enzyme correlation

**Example Questions**:
1. "Analyze this LC-MS metabolomics data for differential metabolites"
2. "Which metabolic pathways are dysregulated between conditions?"
3. "Identify metabolite biomarkers for disease classification"
4. "Correlate metabolite levels with enzyme expression"
5. "Perform pathway enrichment for differential metabolites"
6. "Integrate metabolomics with transcriptomics data"

## Phase Summaries

### Phase 1: Data Import & Identification
Load peak tables (CSV/TSV) or process raw spectra (mzML). Match features to HMDB by accurate mass (+/- 5 ppm). Assign confidence levels: L1 (standard match), L2 (MS/MS), L3 (mass only), L4 (unknown).

### Phase 2: Quality Control
Assess CV in QC samples (reject >30%), compute blank ratios (keep >3x blank), filter features with >50% missing values. Check internal standard recovery (95-105% acceptable).

### Phase 3: Normalization
Three methods available: TIC (simple, assumes similar total abundance), PQN (robust to large changes, recommended), Internal Standard (most accurate with spiked standards). Follow with log2 transform or Pareto scaling.

### Phase 4: Exploratory Analysis
PCA reveals sample grouping and batch effects. PLS-DA provides supervised separation (report R2 and Q2 for model quality). Flag and investigate outliers.

### Phase 5: Differential Analysis
Welch's t-test (two groups) or ANOVA (multiple groups) with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction. Significance thresholds: adj. p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.0.

### Phase 6: Pathway Analysis
Map differential metabolites to KEGG compound IDs. Perform MSEA for pathway enrichment. Consider topology: metabolites at pathway hubs (high degree/betweenness centrality) have greater impact.

### Phase 7: Multi-Omics Integration
Correlate metabolite levels with enzyme expression (Spearman). Expected: substrate-enzyme negative correlation (consumption), product-enzyme positive correlation (production). Score pathway dysregulation using combined metabolite + gene evidence.

### Phase 8: Report
See [report_template.md](report_template.md) for full example output.

## Limitations

- **Identification**: Many features remain unidentified (Level 4)
- **Coverage**: Cannot detect all metabolites (depends on method)
- **Quantification**: Relative abundance (not absolute without standards)
- **Isomers**: Difficult to distinguish structural isomers
- **Ion suppression**: Matrix effects can affect quantification
- **Dynamic range**: Limited compared to targeted methods

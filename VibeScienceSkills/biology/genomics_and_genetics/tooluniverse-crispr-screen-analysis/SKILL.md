# ToolUniverse CRISPR Screen Analysis

Comprehensive skill for analyzing CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens to identify essential genes, synthetic lethal interactions, and therapeutic targets through robust statistical analysis and pathway enrichment.

## Overview

CRISPR screens enable genome-wide functional genomics by systematically perturbing genes and measuring fitness effects. This skill provides an 8-phase workflow for:
- Processing sgRNA count matrices
- Quality control and normalization
- Gene-level essentiality scoring (MAGeCK-like and BAGEL-like approaches)
- Synthetic lethality detection
- Pathway enrichment analysis
- Drug target prioritization with DepMap integration
- Integration with expression and mutation data

---

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Import & sgRNA Count Processing

Load sgRNA count matrix (MAGeCK format or generic TSV). Expected columns: `sgRNA`, `Gene`, plus sample columns. Create experimental design table linking samples to conditions (baseline/treatment) with replicate assignments.

### Phase 2: Quality Control & Filtering

Assess sgRNA distribution quality:
- **Library sizes** per sample (total reads)
- **Zero-count sgRNAs**: Count across samples
- **Low-count filtering**: Remove sgRNAs below threshold (default: <30 reads in >N-2 samples)
- **Gini coefficient**: Assess distribution skewness per sample
- Report filtering recommendations

### Phase 3: Normalization

Normalize sgRNA counts to account for library size differences:
- **Median ratio** (DESeq2-like): Calculate geometric mean reference, compute size factors as median of ratios
- **Total count** (CPM-like): Divide by library size in millions

Calculate log2 fold changes (LFC) between treatment and control conditions with pseudocount.

### Phase 4: Gene-Level Scoring

Two scoring approaches:
- **MAGeCK-like (RRA)**: Rank all sgRNAs by LFC, compute mean rank per gene. Lower mean rank = more essential. Includes sgRNA count and mean LFC per gene.
- **BAGEL-like (Bayes Factor)**: Use reference essential/non-essential gene sets to estimate LFC distributions. Calculate likelihood ratio (Bayes Factor) for each gene. Higher BF = more likely essential.

### Phase 5: Synthetic Lethality Detection

Compare essentiality scores between wildtype and mutant cell lines:
- Merge gene scores, calculate delta LFC and delta rank
- Filter for genes essential in mutant (LFC < threshold) but not wildtype (LFC > -0.5) with large rank change
- Sort by differential essentiality

Query DepMap/literature for known dependencies using PubMed search.

### Phase 6: Pathway Enrichment Analysis

Submit top essential genes to Enrichr for pathway enrichment:
- KEGG pathways
- GO Biological Process
- Retrieve enriched terms with p-values and gene lists

### Phase 7: Drug Target Prioritization

Composite scoring combining:
- **Essentiality** (50% weight): Normalized mean LFC from CRISPR screen
- **Expression** (30% weight): Log2 fold change from RNA-seq (if available)
- **Druggability** (20% weight): Number of drug interactions from DGIdb

Query DGIdb for each candidate gene to find existing drugs, interaction types, and sources.

### Phase 8: Report Generation

Generate markdown report with:
- Summary statistics (total genes, essential genes, non-essential genes)
- Top 20 essential genes table (rank, gene, mean LFC, sgRNAs, score)
- Pathway enrichment results (top 10 terms per database)
- Drug target candidates (rank, gene, essentiality, expression FC, druggability, priority score)
- Methods section

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd
from tooluniverse import ToolUniverse

# 1. Load data
counts, meta = load_sgrna_counts("sgrna_counts.txt")
design = create_design_matrix(['T0_1', 'T0_2', 'T14_1', 'T14_2'],
                               ['baseline', 'baseline', 'treatment', 'treatment'])

# 2. Process
filtered_counts, filtered_mapping = filter_low_count_sgrnas(counts, meta['sgrna_to_gene'])
norm_counts, _ = normalize_counts(filtered_counts)
lfc, _, _ = calculate_lfc(norm_counts, design)

# 3. Score genes
gene_scores = mageck_gene_scoring(lfc, filtered_mapping)

# 4. Enrich pathways
enrichment = enrich_essential_genes(gene_scores, top_n=100)

# 5. Find drug targets
drug_targets = prioritize_drug_targets(gene_scores)

# 6. Generate report
report = generate_crispr_report(gene_scores, enrichment, drug_targets)
```

## Interpretation Framework

| Evidence Grade | Criteria | Validation Priority |
|----------------|----------|---------------------|
| **A -- Strong hit** | MAGeCK RRA p < 0.001, BAGEL BF > 5, >=3 sgRNAs with concordant LFC | Immediate validation (individual KO, growth assay) |
| **B -- Moderate hit** | MAGeCK RRA p < 0.01, BAGEL BF 2-5, >=2 concordant sgRNAs | Secondary validation pool |
| **C -- Weak/ambiguous** | p > 0.01, BF < 2, or discordant sgRNA effects | Deprioritize; check for copy-number bias or seed effects |

**Interpreting screen results:**
- A gene with mean LFC < -1.0 across replicates and >=3 concordant sgRNAs is a robust essentiality hit; single-sgRNA effects are more likely off-target and should be flagged.
- Essential gene thresholds are context-dependent: core fitness genes (e.g., ribosomal, spliceosomal) should deplete in any screen and serve as positive controls -- their absence from the hit list indicates a QC problem.
- Synthetic lethal hits (depleted in mutant but not wildtype) require delta-LFC > 1.5 and confirmation in an independent cell line before therapeutic target nomination.

**Synthesis questions to address in the report:**
1. Do the top hits cluster in known pathways (Reactome/KEGG), or are they scattered -- suggesting technical noise?
2. Are known essential genes (Hart et al. reference set) correctly identified, confirming screen quality?
3. For drug target candidates: does DGIdb show existing compounds, and does DepMap confirm the dependency across multiple cell lines?

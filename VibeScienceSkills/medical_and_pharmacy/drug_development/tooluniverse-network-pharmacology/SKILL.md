description: Construct and analyze compound-target-disease networks for drug repurposing, polypharmacology discovery, and systems pharmacology. Builds multi-layer networks from ChEMBL, OpenTargets, STRING, DrugBank, Reactome, FAERS, and 60+ other ToolUniverse tools. Calculates Network Pharmacology Scores (0-100), identifies repurposing candidates, predicts mechanisms, and analyzes polypharmacology. Use when users ask about drug repurposing via network analysis, multi-target drug effects, compound-target-disease networks, systems pharmacology, or polypharmacology.

# Network Pharmacology Pipeline

Construct and analyze compound-target-disease (C-T-D) networks to identify drug repurposing opportunities, understand polypharmacology, and predict drug mechanisms using systems pharmacology approaches.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use English terms in tool calls (drug names, disease names, target names), even if the user writes in another language. Only try original-language terms as a fallback if English returns no results. Respond in the user's language.

## When to Use This Skill

Apply when users:
- Ask "Can [drug] be repurposed for [disease] based on network analysis?"
- Want to understand multi-target (polypharmacology) effects of a compound
- Need compound-target-disease network construction and analysis
- Ask about network proximity between drug targets and disease genes
- Want systems pharmacology analysis of a drug or target
- Ask about drug repurposing candidates ranked by network metrics
- Need mechanism prediction for a drug in a new indication
- Want to identify hub genes in disease networks as therapeutic targets
- Ask about disease module coverage by a compound's targets

**NOT for** (use other skills instead):
- Simple drug repurposing without network analysis -> Use `tooluniverse-drug-repurposing`
- Single target validation -> Use `tooluniverse-drug-target-validation`
- Adverse event detection only -> Use `tooluniverse-adverse-event-detection`
- General disease research -> Use `tooluniverse-disease-research`
- GWAS interpretation -> Use `tooluniverse-gwas-snp-interpretation`

## Network Pharmacology Score (0-100)

| Component | Max Points | Criteria for Max |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Network Proximity | 35 | Z < -2, p < 0.01 |
| Clinical Evidence | 25 | Approved for related indication |
| Target-Disease Association | 20 | Strong genetic evidence (GWAS, rare variants) |
| Safety Profile | 10 | FDA-approved, favorable safety |
| Mechanism Plausibility | 10 | Clear pathway mechanism with functional evidence |

### Priority Tiers

| Score | Tier | Recommendation |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **80-100** | Tier 1 | High repurposing potential - proceed with experimental validation |
| **60-79** | Tier 2 | Good potential - needs mechanistic validation |
| **40-59** | Tier 3 | Moderate potential - high-risk/high-reward |
| **0-39** | Tier 4 | Low potential - consider alternative approaches |

### Evidence Grading

| Tier | Criteria | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **T1** | Human clinical proof, regulatory evidence | FDA-approved, Phase III trial |
| **T2** | Functional experimental evidence | IC50 < 1 uM, CRISPR screen |
| **T3** | Association/computational evidence | GWAS hit, network proximity |
| **T4** | Prediction, annotation, text-mining | AlphaFold, literature co-mention |

## Key Principles

1. **Report-first approach** - Create report file FIRST, then populate progressively
2. **Entity disambiguation FIRST** - Resolve all identifiers before analysis
3. **Bidirectional network** - Construct C-T-D network comprehensively from both directions
4. **Network metrics** - Calculate proximity, centrality, module overlap quantitatively
5. **Rank candidates** - Prioritize by composite Network Pharmacology Score
6. **Mechanism prediction** - Explain HOW drug could work for disease via network paths
7. **Clinical feasibility** - FDA-approved drugs ranked higher than preclinical
8. **Safety context** - Flag known adverse events and off-target liabilities
9. **Evidence grading** - Grade all evidence T1-T4
10. **Negative results documented** - "No data" is data; empty sections are failures
11. **Source references** - Every finding must cite the source tool/database
12. **Completeness checklist** - Mandatory section at end showing analysis coverage

## Workflow Overview

### Phase 0: Entity Disambiguation and Report Setup
- Create report file immediately
- Resolve entity to all required IDs (ChEMBL, DrugBank, PubChem CID, Ensembl, MONDO/EFO)
- Tools: `OpenTargets_get_drug_chembId_by_generic_name`, `drugbank_get_drug_basic_info_by_drug_name_or_id`, `PubChem_get_CID_by_compound_name`, `OpenTargets_get_target_id_description_by_name`, `OpenTargets_get_disease_id_description_by_name`

### Phase 1: Network Node Identification
- **Compound nodes**: Drug targets, mechanism of action, current indications
- **Target nodes**: Disease-associated genes, GWAS targets, druggability levels
- **Disease nodes**: Related diseases, hierarchy, phenotypes

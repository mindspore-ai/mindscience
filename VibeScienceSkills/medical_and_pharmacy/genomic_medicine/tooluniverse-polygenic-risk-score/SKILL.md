# Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Builder

Build and interpret polygenic risk scores for complex diseases using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data.

## Overview

**Use Cases:**
- "Calculate my genetic risk for type 2 diabetes"
- "Build a polygenic risk score for coronary artery disease"
- "What's my genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease?"
- "Interpret my PRS percentile for breast cancer risk"

**What This Skill Does:**
- Extracts genome-wide significant variants (p < 5e-8) from GWAS Catalog
- Builds weighted PRS models using effect sizes (beta coefficients)
- Calculates individual risk scores from genotype data
- Interprets PRS as population percentiles and risk categories

**What This Skill Does NOT Do:**
- Diagnose disease (PRS is probabilistic, not deterministic)
- Replace clinical assessment or genetic counseling
- Account for non-genetic factors (lifestyle, environment)
- Provide treatment recommendations

## Methodology

### PRS Calculation Formula

A polygenic risk score is calculated as a weighted sum across genetic variants:

```
PRS = Σ (dosage_i × effect_size_i)
```

Where:
- **dosage_i**: Number of effect alleles at SNP i (0, 1, or 2)
- **effect_size_i**: Beta coefficient or log(odds ratio) from GWAS

### Standardization

Raw PRS is standardized to z-scores for interpretation:

```
z-score = (PRS - population_mean) / population_std
```

This allows comparison to population distribution and percentile calculation.

### Significance Thresholds

- **Genome-wide significance**: p < 5×10⁻⁸ (default threshold)
- This corrects for ~1 million independent tests across the genome
- Relaxed thresholds (e.g., p < 1×10⁻⁵) can include more SNPs but may add noise

### Effect Size Handling

- **Continuous traits** (e.g., height, BMI): Beta coefficient (units of trait per allele)
- **Binary traits** (e.g., disease): Odds ratio converted to log-odds (beta = ln(OR))
- Missing effect sizes or non-significant SNPs are excluded

## Data Sources

This skill uses ToolUniverse GWAS tools to query:

1. **GWAS Catalog** (EMBL-EBI)
   - Curated GWAS associations, 5000+ studies
   - Tools: `gwas_search_associations` (param: `disease_trait`, `size`; also `gwas_get_associations_for_trait`), `gwas_get_snps_for_gene` (param: `gene_symbol`), `dbsnp_get_variant_by_rsid`
   - Note: `disease_trait` search returns associations where the trait is one of potentially several linked EFO traits. For precise filtering, use EFO IDs via `efo_trait` param.

2. **Open Targets Genetics**
   - Integrated genetics platform with fine-mapped credible sets
   - Tools: `OpenTargets_search_gwas_studies_by_disease`, `EnsemblVEP_annotate_hgvs` (for variant consequence/frequency)

3. **Variant Annotation**
   - `gnomad_search_variants` + `gnomad_get_variant` — population allele frequencies (ancestry-specific via VEP colocated_variants)
   - `MyVariant_query_variants` — CADD, SIFT, PolyPhen, ClinVar, gnomAD in one call
   - `gnomad_get_gene_constraints` — gene constraint metrics (pLI, oe_lof) for target prioritization

## Key Concepts

### Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)

Polygenic risk scores aggregate the effects of many genetic variants to estimate an individual's genetic predisposition to a trait or disease. Unlike Mendelian diseases caused by single mutations, complex diseases involve hundreds to thousands of variants, each with small effects.

**Key Properties:**
- **Continuous distribution**: PRS forms a bell curve in populations
- **Relative risk**: Compares individual to population average
- **Probabilistic**: High PRS doesn't guarantee disease, low PRS doesn't guarantee protection
- **Ancestry-specific**: PRS accuracy depends on matching GWAS and target ancestry

### GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies)

GWAS compare allele frequencies between cases and controls (or correlate with trait values) across millions of SNPs to identify disease-associated variants.

**Study Design:**
- **Discovery cohort**: Initial identification of associations
- **Replication cohort**: Validation in independent samples
- **Sample size**: Larger studies detect smaller effects (power ∝ √N)
- **Multiple testing correction**: Bonferroni-type correction for ~1M tests

### Effect Sizes and Odds Ratios

- **Beta (β)**: Change in trait per copy of effect allele
  - Example: β = 0.5 kg/m² means each allele increases BMI by 0.5 units
- **Odds Ratio (OR)**: Multiplicative change in disease odds
  - OR = 1.5 means 50% increased odds per allele
  - Convert to beta: β = ln(OR)

### Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) and Clumping

Nearby variants are often inherited together (LD). To avoid double-counting:
- **LD clumping**: Select independent variants (r² < 0.1 within 1 Mb windows)
- **Fine-mapping**: Statistical methods to identify causal variants
- This skill uses raw associations; production PRS should include LD pruning

### Population Stratification

GWAS and PRS are most accurate when ancestries match:
- **Population structure**: Different ancestries have different allele frequencies
- **Transferability**: European-trained PRS perform worse in non-European populations
- **Solution**: Train PRS on diverse cohorts or use ancestry-matched references

## Applications

### Clinical Risk Assessment

PRS can stratify individuals for:
- **Screening programs**: Target high-risk individuals (e.g., mammography, colonoscopy)
- **Prevention strategies**: Lifestyle interventions for high genetic risk
- **Drug response**: Pharmacogenomics based on metabolism genes

**Example**: Khera et al. (2018) showed PRS identifies 3× more individuals at >3-fold coronary artery disease risk than monogenic mutations.

### Research Applications

- **Gene discovery**: PRS-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS)
- **Genetic correlation**: Compare PRS across traits
- **Causal inference**: Mendelian randomization using PRS as instruments
- **Simulation studies**: Model polygenic architecture

### Personal Genomics

Consumer genetic testing (23andMe, Ancestry DNA) provides raw genotypes. Users can:
- Calculate PRS for traits not reported
- Compare to published PRS models
- Understand genetic contribution vs. lifestyle factors

**Caution**: Personal PRS should not replace medical advice. Results may cause anxiety if not properly contextualized.

## Limitations and Considerations

### Scientific Limitations

1. **Heritability Gap**: PRS explains a fraction of genetic heritability
   - Type 2 diabetes: ~50% heritable, PRS explains ~10-20%
   - Rare variants, epistasis, and gene-environment interactions not captured

2. **Ancestry Bias**: Most GWAS are European ancestry
   - PRS accuracy drops in non-European populations
   - Need for diverse cohort recruitment

3. **Winner's Curse**: Discovery effect sizes often overestimated
   - Replication studies show smaller effects
   - Meta-analyses provide better estimates

4. **Missing Heritability**: Unexplained genetic contribution from:
   - Rare variants not captured by SNP arrays
   - Structural variants (CNVs, inversions)
   - Epigenetic factors

### Clinical Limitations

1. **Not Diagnostic**: PRS is probabilistic, not deterministic
   - High PRS doesn't mean you will get disease
   - Low PRS doesn't mean you won't get disease

2. **Environmental Factors**: Many complex diseases are 50%+ environmental
   - Smoking, diet, exercise, stress, pollution
   - PRS doesn't account for these

3. **Pleiotropy**: Same variants affect multiple traits
   - Genetic correlation between diseases
   - Risk for one may protect against another

4. **Actionability**: Not all high-risk predictions have interventions
   - Alzheimer's PRS has limited actionability currently
   - Ethical considerations for testing

### Ethical Considerations

1. **Privacy**: Genetic data is identifiable and permanent
   - Can't be changed like passwords
   - Familial implications (relatives share genetics)

2. **Discrimination**: Potential for genetic discrimination
   - GINA protects against health/employment discrimination (US)
   - Life insurance and long-term care not protected

3. **Psychological Impact**: Knowledge of high risk can cause anxiety
   - Need for genetic counseling
   - Risk communication training

4. **Equity**: Ancestry bias means unequal benefits
   - Europeans benefit most from current PRS
   - Exacerbates health disparities

## Workflow

### 1. Trait Selection

Identify the disease or trait of interest:
- Use standard terminology (e.g., "type 2 diabetes" not "T2D")
- Check GWAS Catalog for availability
- Verify sufficient GWAS studies exist (n > 10,000 samples ideal)

### 2. Association Collection

Query GWAS databases for genome-wide significant associations:
```python
prs = build_polygenic_risk_score(
    trait="coronary artery disease",
    p_threshold=5e-8,  # Genome-wide significance
    max_snps=1000
)
```

**Considerations:**
- P-value threshold: 5e-8 is conservative, 1e-5 includes more variants
- LD clumping: Production systems should prune correlated SNPs
- Study quality: Prefer large meta-analyses over small studies

### 3. Effect Size Extraction

Extract beta coefficients or odds ratios:
- Beta for continuous traits (direct use)
- OR for binary traits (convert to log-odds)
- Handle missing values (exclude or impute from meta-analysis)

### 4. SNP Filtering

Quality control filters:
- **MAF filter**: Exclude rare variants (MAF < 0.01) for robustness
- **Genotype QC**: Remove SNPs with high missingness (> 10%)
- **Hardy-Weinberg**: Exclude SNPs violating HWE (p < 1e-6)
- **Ambiguous SNPs**: Remove A/T and G/C SNPs (strand ambiguity)

### 5. Score Calculation

Calculate weighted sum of genotype dosages:
```python
result = calculate_personal_prs(
    prs_weights=prs,
    genotypes=my_genotypes,
    population_mean=0.0,
    population_std=1.0
)
```

**Genotype Sources:**
- 23andMe raw data export
- Ancestry DNA raw data
- Whole genome sequencing (VCF files)
- SNP array data (Illumina, Affymetrix)

### 6. Risk Interpretation

Convert to percentiles and risk categories:
```python
result = interpret_prs_percentile(result)
print(f"Percentile: {result.percentile:.1f}%")
print(f"Risk: {result.risk_category}")
```

**Risk Categories:**
- **Low risk**: < 20th percentile (genetic protection)
- **Average risk**: 20-80th percentile (typical genetic predisposition)
- **Elevated risk**: 80-95th percentile (moderately increased risk)
- **High risk**: > 95th percentile (substantially increased risk)

**Clinical Interpretation:**
- Percentiles assume normal distribution
- Relative risk vs. average (not absolute risk)
- Combine with family history, clinical risk factors
- PRS is NOT diagnostic - many high-risk individuals never develop disease

## Best Practices

### PRS Construction

1. **Use validated PRS from PGS Catalog** when available
   - Published models have been externally validated
   - Include LD clumping and ancestry-specific weights

2. **Match ancestries** between GWAS and target population
   - European GWAS for European individuals
   - Use multi-ancestry GWAS when available

3. **Include as many SNPs as practical**
   - More SNPs = better prediction (up to a point)
   - Balance between coverage and genotyping cost

4. **Consider trait architecture**
   - Highly polygenic traits (height, education): benefit from relaxed thresholds
   - Oligogenic traits (IBD, T1D): few large-effect variants, strict thresholds

### Clinical Use

1. **Combine with clinical risk scores**
   - Add PRS to Framingham Risk Score, QRISK, etc.
   - Integrated models improve prediction

2. **Stratify screening and prevention**
   - Intensify surveillance for high PRS (e.g., earlier mammography)
   - Lifestyle interventions for modifiable risk

3. **Provide genetic counseling**
   - Explain probabilistic nature of PRS
   - Discuss limitations and uncertainty
   - Address psychological impact

4. **Consider actionability**
   - Is there an intervention for high risk?
   - Benefits vs. harms of knowing genetic risk

### Research Use

1. **Report methods transparently**
   - Document SNP selection criteria
   - Report LD clumping parameters
   - Specify ancestry of GWAS and target

2. **Validate in held-out cohorts**
   - Split data: training vs. testing
   - Report out-of-sample prediction accuracy (R², AUC)

3. **Compare to existing PRS**
   - Benchmark against PGS Catalog models
   - Report incremental improvement

4. **Test across ancestries**
   - Evaluate transferability to non-European populations
   - Report performance stratified by ancestry

## Disclaimer

**This skill is for educational and research purposes only.**

- **Not for clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions**
- **Not validated for clinical use** - use PGS Catalog models for clinical-grade PRS
- **Requires genetic counseling** - interpretation requires expertise
- **Does not account for family history, environment, or lifestyle factors**
- **Ancestry-specific** - accuracy depends on matching GWAS ancestry

**For clinical genetic testing, consult:**

# Infectious Disease Outbreak Intelligence

Rapid response system for emerging pathogens using taxonomy analysis, target identification, structure prediction, and computational drug repurposing.

**KEY PRINCIPLES**:
1. **Speed is critical** - Optimize for rapid actionable intelligence
2. **Target essential proteins** - Focus on conserved, essential viral/bacterial proteins
3. **Leverage existing drugs** - Prioritize FDA-approved compounds for repurposing
4. **Structure-guided** - Use NvidiaNIM for rapid structure prediction and docking
5. **Evidence-graded** - Grade repurposing candidates by evidence strength
6. **Actionable output** - Prioritized drug candidates with rationale
7. **English-first queries** - Always use English terms in tool calls; respond in user's language

## When to Use

Apply when user asks:
- "New pathogen detected - what drugs might work?"
- "Emerging virus [X] - therapeutic options?"
- "Drug repurposing candidates for [pathogen]"
- "What do we know about [novel coronavirus/bacteria]?"
- "Essential targets in [pathogen] for drug development"
- "Can we repurpose [drug] against [pathogen]?"

## Critical Workflow Requirements

### 1. Report-First Approach (MANDATORY)

1. Create `[PATHOGEN]_outbreak_intelligence.md` FIRST with section headers
2. Progressively update as data is gathered
3. Output separate files: `[PATHOGEN]_drug_candidates.csv`, `[PATHOGEN]_target_proteins.csv`

### 2. Citation Requirements (MANDATORY)

Every finding must have inline source attribution:
```markdown
### Target: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
- **UniProt**: P0DTD1 (NSP12)
- **Essentiality**: Required for replication
*Source: UniProt via `UniProt_search`, literature review*
```

## Phase 0: Tool Verification

### Known Parameter Corrections

| Tool | WRONG Parameter | CORRECT Parameter |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| `NCBIDatasets_get_taxonomy` | `name` | `tax_id` (integer) or use `BVBRC_search_taxonomy` for keyword search |
| `UniProt_search` | `name` | `query` |
| `ChEMBL_search_targets` | `query`, `target` | `pref_name__contains` (substring match) |
| `get_diffdock_info` | `protein_file` | `protein` (content) |
| `drugbank_full_search` | _(may fail)_ | Use `drugbank_vocab_search` as primary DrugBank lookup |

> **PubMed tip**: Use `sort="relevance"` (default) not `sort="pub_date"` — date-sorted queries can return empty for narrow topics. Tool name: `PubMed_search_articles`.
> **FDA labels**: Use `FDA_get_drug_label_info_by_field_value` with targeted `return_fields` to avoid oversized responses from `OpenFDA_search_drug_labels`.

## Phase Summaries

### Phase 1: Pathogen Identification
Classify via NCBI Taxonomy (query param). Identify related pathogens with existing drugs for knowledge transfer. Determine genome/proteome availability.

**Pathogen classification decision tree** — determines the repurposing strategy:

| Pathogen Type | Drug Strategy | Key Targets | Example |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **RNA virus** | Polymerase inhibitors (nucleoside analogs), protease inhibitors | RdRp, main protease, helicase | SARS-CoV-2 → remdesivir, nirmatrelvir |
| **DNA virus** | Polymerase inhibitors, kinase inhibitors | DNA pol, thymidine kinase | HSV → acyclovir |
| **Gram-negative bacteria** | Cell wall (beta-lactams), ribosome (aminoglycosides), topoisomerase (fluoroquinolones) | PBPs, 30S/50S ribosome, DNA gyrase | E. coli → meropenem |
| **Gram-positive bacteria** | Cell wall (vancomycin), ribosome (macrolides), cell membrane (daptomycin) | PBPs, 50S ribosome, membrane | MRSA → vancomycin |
| **Mycobacteria (acid-fast)** | Cell wall mycolic acid (isoniazid), RNA polymerase (rifampin), ATP synthase (bedaquiline), DNA gyrase (fluoroquinolones) | InhA, RpoB, AtpE, GyrA | M. tuberculosis → HRZE regimen |
| **Fungal** | Ergosterol (azoles), cell wall (echinocandins), nucleic acid (flucytosine) | Lanosterol demethylase, glucan synthase | Candida → fluconazole |
| **Parasite** | Variable by species; often metabolic targets | DHFR, proteasome, kinases | Plasmodium → artemisinin |

**Knowledge transfer principle**: Drugs effective against related pathogens are the highest-priority repurposing candidates. A protease inhibitor for SARS-CoV-1 is immediately relevant to SARS-CoV-2.

### Phase 2: Target Identification
Search UniProt for pathogen proteins (reviewed). Check ChEMBL for drug precedent. Score targets by: Essentiality (30%), Conservation (25%), Druggability (25%), Drug precedent (20%). Aim for 5+ targets.

### Phase 3: Structure Prediction
Use NvidiaNIM AlphaFold2 for top 3 targets. Assess pLDDT confidence. Only dock structures with pLDDT > 70 (active site > 90 preferred). Fallback: alphafold_get_prediction or ESMFold_predict_structure.

### Phase 4: Drug Repurposing Screen
Source candidates from: related pathogen drugs, broad-spectrum antivirals, target class drugs (DGIdb). Dock top 20+ candidates via get_diffdock_info. Rank by docking score and evidence tier.

### Phase 4.5: Pathway Analysis
Use KEGG to identify essential metabolic pathways. Map host-pathogen interaction points. Identify pathway-based drug targets beyond direct protein inhibition.

### Phase 5: Literature Intelligence
Search PubMed (peer-reviewed), BioRxiv/MedRxiv (preprints - critical for outbreaks), ArXiv (computational), ClinicalTrials.gov (active trials). Track citations via OpenAlex. Note: preprints are NOT peer-reviewed.

### Phase 6: Report Synthesis
Aggregate all findings into final report. Grade every candidate. Provide 3+ immediate actions, clinical trial opportunities, and research priorities.

## Evidence Grading

| Tier | Symbol | Criteria | Example |
|------|--------|----------|---------|
| **T1** | [T1] | FDA approved for this pathogen | Remdesivir for COVID |
| **T2** | [T2] | Clinical trial evidence OR approved for related pathogen | Favipiravir |
| **T3** | [T3] | In vitro activity OR strong docking + mechanism | Sofosbuvir |
| **T4** | [T4] | Computational prediction only | Novel docking hits |

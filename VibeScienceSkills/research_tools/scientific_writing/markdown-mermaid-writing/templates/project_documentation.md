# Project Documentation Template

> **Back to [Markdown Style Guide](../markdown_style_guide.md)** — Read the style guide first for formatting, citation, and emoji rules.

**Use this template for:** Software projects, open-source libraries, internal tools, APIs, platforms, or any product that needs documentation for users and contributors. Designed to take someone from "what is this?" to "I'm contributing" in a single read.

**Key features:** Quick start that gets people running in under 5 minutes, architecture overview with Mermaid diagrams, API reference structure, troubleshooting section that addresses real problems, and contribution guidelines.

**Philosophy:** The best project docs eliminate the need to read the source code to understand the system. A new team member should be productive in hours, not weeks. Every "how does this work?" question should have an answer in this document or be one click away.

## How to Use

1. Copy this file as your project's main `README.md` or `docs/index.md`
2. Replace all `[bracketed placeholders]` with your content
3. Delete sections that don't apply (a CLI tool might skip API reference; a library might skip deployment)
4. Add [Mermaid diagrams](../mermaid_style_guide.md) — especially for architecture, data flow, and request lifecycle
5. Keep the Quick Start brutally simple — if setup takes more than 5 commands, simplify it

## 🚀 Quick start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement        | Version     | Check command         |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------- |
| [Runtime/Language] | ≥ [version] | `[command] --version` |

| [Tool]             | ≥ [version] | `[command] --version` |

### Install and run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[org]/[repo].git
cd [repo]

# Install dependencies
[package-manager] install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your values

# Start the application
[package-manager] run dev
```

**Verify it works:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:[port]/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok", "version": "[version]"}
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### System overview

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common issues

#### "Connection refused" on startup

**Cause:** Database is not running or connection string is incorrect.

**Fix:**

1. Verify database is running: `[check-command]`
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
3. Test connection: `[test-command]`

#### "[Specific error message]"

**Cause:** [What triggers this error]

**Fix:**

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

#### Slow response times

**Cause:** [Common causes — missing indexes, cache cold start, etc.]

**Fix:**

1. Check cache connectivity: `[command]`
2. Verify database indexes: `[command]`
3. Review recent changes to query patterns
